  Abstract                 = {The advent of genome-scale genetic and genomic studies allows new insight into disease classification. Recently, a shift was made from linking diseases simply based on their shared genes towards systems-level integration of molecular data. Here, we aim to find relationships between diseases based on evidence from fusing all available molecular interaction and ontology data. We propose a multi-level hierarchy of disease classes that significantly overlaps with existing disease classification. In it, we find 14 disease-disease associations currently not present in Disease Ontology and provide evidence for their relationships through comorbidity data and literature curation. Interestingly, even though the number of known human genetic interactions is currently very small, we find they are the most important predictor of a link between diseases. Finally, we show that omission of any one of the included data sources reduces prediction quality, further highlighting the importance in the paradigm shift towards systems-level data fusion.},

  Abstract                 = {Adipocytes are central players in energy metabolism and the obesity epidemic, yet their protein composition remains largely unexplored. We investigated the adipocyte proteome by combining high accuracy, high sensitivity protein identification technology with subcellular fractionation of nuclei, mitochondria, membrane, and cytosol of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We identified 3,287 proteins while essentially eliminating false positives, making this one of the largest high confidence proteomes reported to date. Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis revealed that the adipocyte proteome, despite its specialized role, is very complex. Comparison with microarray data showed that the mRNA abundance of detected versus non-detected proteins differed by less than 2-fold and that proteomics covered as large a proportion of the insulin signaling pathway. We used the Endeavour gene prioritization algorithm to associate a number of factors with vesicle transport in response to insulin stimulation, a key function of adipocytes. Our data and analysis can serve as a model for cellular proteomics. The adipocyte proteome is available as supplemental material and from the Max-Planck Unified Proteome database.},

  Abstract                 = {According to Cobanoglu et al., it is now widely acknowledged that the single target paradigm (one protein/target, one disease, one drug) that has been the dominant premise in drug development in the recent past is untenable. More often than not, a drug-like compound (ligand) can be promiscuous - it can interact with more than one target protein. In recent years, in in silico target prediction methods the promiscuity issue has generally been approached computationally in three main ways: ligand-based methods; target-protein-based methods; and integrative schemes. In this study we confine attention to ligand-based target prediction machine learning approaches, commonly referred to as target-fishing. The target-fishing approaches that are currently ubiquitous in cheminformatics literature can be essentially viewed as single-label multi-classification schemes; these approaches inherently bank on the single target paradigm assumption that a ligand can zero in on one single target. In order to address the ligand promiscuity issue, one might be able to cast target-fishing as a multi-label multi-class classification problem. For illustrative and comparison purposes, single-label and multi-label Naïve Bayes classification models (denoted here by SMM and MMM, respectively) for target-fishing were implemented. The models were constructed and tested on 65,587 compounds/ligands and 308 targets retrieved from the ChEMBL17 database.On classifying 3,332 test multi-label (promiscuous) compounds, SMM and MMM performed differently. At the 0.05 significance level, a Wilcoxon signed rank test performed on the paired target predictions yielded by SMM and MMM for the test ligands gave a p-value < 5.1 × 10(-94) and test statistics value of 6.8 × 10(5), in favour of MMM. The two models performed differently when tested on four datasets comprising single-label (non-promiscuous) compounds; McNemar's test yielded χ (2) values of 15.657, 16.500 and 16.405 (with corresponding p-values of 7.594 × 10(-05), 4.865 × 10(-05) and 5.115 × 10(-05)), respectively, for three test sets, in favour of MMM. The models performed similarly on the fourth set.The target prediction results obtained in this study indicate that multi-label multi-class approaches are more apt than the ubiquitous single-label multi-class schemes when it comes to the application of ligand-based classifiers to target-fishing.},

  Abstract                 = {Mammalian central nervous system (CNS) neurons regrow their axons poorly following injury, resulting in irreversible functional losses. Identifying therapeutics that encourage CNS axon repair has been difficult, in part because multiple etiologies underlie this regenerative failure. This suggests a particular need for drugs that engage multiple molecular targets. Although multitarget drugs are generally more effective than highly selective alternatives, we lack systematic methods for discovering such drugs. Target-based screening is an efficient technique for identifying potent modulators of individual targets. In contrast, phenotypic screening can identify drugs with multiple targets; however, these targets remain unknown. To address this gap, we combined the two drug discovery approaches using machine learning and information theory. We screened compounds in a phenotypic assay with primary CNS neurons and also in a panel of kinase enzyme assays. We used learning algorithms to relate the compounds' kinase inhibition profiles to their influence on neurite outgrowth. This allowed us to identify kinases that may serve as targets for promoting neurite outgrowth as well as others whose targeting should be avoided. We found that compounds that inhibit multiple targets (polypharmacology) promote robust neurite outgrowth in vitro. One compound with exemplary polypharmacology was found to promote axon growth in a rodent spinal cord injury model. A more general applicability of our approach is suggested by its ability to deconvolve known targets for a breast cancer cell line as well as targets recently shown to mediate drug resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {With data from recent large-scale drug sensitivity measurement campaigns, it is now possible to build and test models predicting responses for more than one hundred anticancer drugs against several hundreds of human cancer cell lines. Traditional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approaches focus on small molecules in searching for their structural properties predictive of the biological activity in a single cell line or a single tissue type. We extend this line of research in two directions: (1) an integrative QSAR approach predicting the responses to new drugs for a panel of multiple known cancer cell lines simultaneously and (2) a personalized QSAR approach predicting the responses to new drugs for new cancer cell lines. To solve the modeling task, we apply a novel kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization method. For maximum applicability and predictive performance, the method optionally utilizes genomic features of cell lines and target information on drugs in addition to chemical drug descriptors. In a case study with 116 anticancer drugs and 650 cell lines, we demonstrate the usefulness of the method in several relevant prediction scenarios, differing in the amount of available information, and analyze the importance of various types of drug features for the response prediction. Furthermore, after predicting the missing values of the data set, a complete global map of drug response is explored to assess treatment potential and treatment range of therapeutically interesting anticancer drugs.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug repositioning, an innovative therapeutic application of an old drug, has received much attention as a particularly costeffective strategy in drug R&D Recent work has indicated that repositioning can be promoted by utilizing a wide range of information sources, including medicinal chemical, target, mechanism, main and side-effect-related information, and also bibliometric and taxonomical fingerprints, signatures and knowledge bases. This article describes the adaptation of a conceptually novel, more efficient approach for the identification of new possible therapeutic applications of approved drugs and drug candidates, based on a kernel-based data fusion method. This strategy includes (1) the potentially multiple representation of information sources, (2) the automated weighting and statistically optimal combination of information sources, and (3) the automated weighting of parts of the query compounds. The performance was systematically evaluated by using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System classes in a cross-validation framework. The results confirmed that kernel-based data fusion can integrate heterogeneous information sources significantly better than standard rank-based fusion can, and this method provides a unique solution for repositioning; it can also be utilized for de novo drug discovery. The advantages of kernel-based data fusion are illustrated with examples and open problems that are particularly relevant for pharmaceutical applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Understanding whether different environmental chemicals and druglike molecules impact mitochondrial function represents an initial step in predicting exposure-related toxicity and defining a possible role for such compounds in the onset of various diseases.We sought to identify individual chemicals and general structural features associated with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP).We used a multiplexed [two end points in one screen; MMP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content] quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) approach combined with informatics tools to screen the Tox21 library of 10,000 compounds (~ 8,300 unique chemicals) at 15 concentrations each in triplicate to identify chemicals and structural features that are associated with changes in MMP in HepG2 cells.Approximately 11\% of the compounds (913 unique compounds) decreased MMP after 1 hr of treatment without affecting cell viability (ATP content). In addition, 309 compounds decreased MMP over a concentration range that also produced measurable cytotoxicity [half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in MMP assay/IC50 in viability assay ≤ 3; p < 0.05]. More than 11\% of the structural clusters that constitute the Tox21 library (76 of 651 clusters) were significantly enriched for compounds that decreased the MMP.Our multiplexed qHTS approach allowed us to generate a robust and reliable data set to evaluate the ability of thousands of drugs and environmental compounds to decrease MMP. The use of structure-based clustering analysis allowed us to identify molecular features that are likely responsible for the observed activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Generally, QSAR modelling requires both model selection and validation since there is no a priori knowledge about the optimal QSAR model. Prediction errors (PE) are frequently used to select and to assess the models under study. Reliable estimation of prediction errors is challenging - especially under model uncertainty - and requires independent test objects. These test objects must not be involved in model building nor in model selection. Double cross-validation, sometimes also termed nested cross-validation, offers an attractive possibility to generate test data and to select QSAR models since it uses the data very efficiently. Nevertheless, there is a controversy in the literature with respect to the reliability of double cross-validation under model uncertainty. Moreover, systematic studies investigating the adequate parameterization of double cross-validation are still missing. Here, the cross-validation design in the inner loop and the influence of the test set size in the outer loop is systematically studied for regression models in combination with variable selection.Simulated and real data are analysed with double cross-validation to identify important factors for the resulting model quality. For the simulated data, a bias-variance decomposition is provided.The prediction errors of QSAR/QSPR regression models in combination with variable selection depend to a large degree on the parameterization of double cross-validation. While the parameters for the inner loop of double cross-validation mainly influence bias and variance of the resulting models, the parameters for the outer loop mainly influence the variability of the resulting prediction error estimate.Double cross-validation reliably and unbiasedly estimates prediction errors under model uncertainty for regression models. As compared to a single test set, double cross-validation provided a more realistic picture of model quality and should be preferred over a single test set.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to better understand the common features present in drug molecules, we use shape description methods to analyze a database of commercially available drugs and prepare a list of common drug shapes. A useful way of organizing this structural data is to group the atoms of each drug molecule into ring, linker, framework, and side chain atoms. On the basis of the two-dimensional molecular structures (without regard to atom type, hybridization, and bond order), there are 1179 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds analyzed. However, the shapes of half of the drugs in the database are described by the 32 most frequently occurring frameworks. This suggests that the diversity of shapes in the set of known drugs is extremely low. In our second method of analysis, in which atom type, hybridization, and bond order are considered, more diversity is seen; there are 2506 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds in the database, and the most frequently occurring 42 frameworks account for only one-fourth of the drugs. We discuss the possible interpretations of these findings and the way they may be used to guide future drug discovery research.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new curated database on in vivo micronucleus mutagenicity results, called ISSMIC. It is freely available at: http://www.iss.it/ampp/dati/cont.php?id=233&lang=1&tipo=7. The experimental results were critically reviewed, and evidence on target cell exposure was considered as well. The inspection of ISSMIC demonstrates that a large proportion of reported negative results in the literature (231 out 566 ISSMIC chemicals) lack a clear-cut, direct demonstration of toxicity at the target cells. Using this updated database, the predictive value of a compilation of Structural Alerts (SA) for in vivo micronucleus recently implemented in the expert system Toxtree was investigated. Individually, most of the SA showed a high Positive Predictivity (80\%), but the need for further expanding the list of alerts was pointed out as well. The role of in vivo micronucleus in strategies for carcinogenicity prediction was re-evaluated. In agreement with previous analyses, the data point to a low overall correlation with carcinogenicity. In addition, given the cost in animal lives and the time required for the experimentation, in many programs, the in vivo tests are used only to assess in vitro positive results. The ability of in vivo micronucleus to identify real positives (i.e. carcinogens) among chemicals positive in Salmonella or among chemicals inducing in vitro chromosomal aberrations was studied. It appears that the in vivo micronucleus test does not have added value and rather impairs the prediction ability of the in vitro tests alone. The overall evidence indicates that in vivo micronucleus--in its present form--cannot be considered an useful tool for routine genotoxicity testing but should be used in targeted mechanistic studies.},

One concern is that compounds selected by phenotypic screening will have a previously known but undesirable target mechanism. Here we describe a useful method for assigning mechanism class to compounds and bioactive agents using an 84-feature signature from a panel of primary human cell systems (BioMAP systems). For this approach, a reference data set of well-characterized compounds was used to develop predictive models for 28 mechanism classes using support vector machines. These mechanism classes encompass safety and efficacy-related mechanisms, include both target-specific and pathway-based classes, and cover the most common mechanisms identified in phenotypic screens, such as inhibitors of mitochondrial and microtubule function, histone deacetylase, and cAMP elevators. Here we describe the performance and the application of these predictive models in a decision scheme for triaging phenotypic screening hits using a previously published data set of 309 environmental chemicals tested as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's ToxCast program. By providing quantified membership in specific mechanism classes, this approach is suitable for identification of off-target toxicity mechanisms as well as enabling target deconvolution of phenotypic drug discovery hits.},

This approach reduces the risk of deducing artificial target relationships from mutually inactive compounds. ARTS implements a scoring scheme that matches intertarget similarity based on dose-response measurements. While all experimentally derived target similarities have a tendency to be data set-dependent, we demonstrate that ARTS depends less on the used data set than the commonly used Pearson correlation or Tanimoto index.},

These individual components were combined to an overall score of synthetic accessibility by an additive scheme. The weights of the scoring function components were calculated by linear regression analysis based on accessibility scores derived from medicinal chemists. The calculated values for synthetic accessibility agree with the values proposed by chemists to an extent that compares well with how chemists agree with each other.},

  Abstract                 = {Algorithms for computer-aided diagnosis of dementia based on structural MRI have demonstrated high performance in the literature, but are difficult to compare as different data sets and methodology were used for evaluation. In addition, it is unclear how the algorithms would perform on previously unseen data, and thus, how they would perform in clinical practice when there is no real opportunity to adapt the algorithm to the data at hand. To address these comparability, generalizability and clinical applicability issues, we organized a grand challenge that aimed to objectively compare algorithms based on a clinically representative multi-center data set. Using clinical practice as the starting point, the goal was to reproduce the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, we evaluated algorithms for multi-class classification of three diagnostic groups: patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The diagnosis based on clinical criteria was used as reference standard, as it was the best available reference despite its known limitations. For evaluation, a previously unseen test set was used consisting of 354 T1-weighted MRI scans with the diagnoses blinded. Fifteen research teams participated with a total of 29 algorithms. The algorithms were trained on a small training set (n=30) and optionally on data from other sources (e.g., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of aging). The best performing algorithm yielded an accuracy of 63.0\% and an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 78.8\%. In general, the best performances were achieved using feature extraction based on voxel-based morphometry or a combination of features that included volume, cortical thickness, shape and intensity. The challenge is open for new submissions via the web-based framework: http://caddementia.grand-challenge.org.},

  Abstract                 = {High-throughput assays challenge us to extract knowledge from multi-ligand, multi-target activity data. In QSAR, weights are statically fitted to each ligand descriptor with respect to a single endpoint or target. However, computational chemogenomics (CG) has demonstrated benefits of learning from entire grids of data at once, rather than building target-specific QSARs. A possible reason for this is the emergence of inductive knowledge transfer (IT) between targets, providing statistical robustness to the model, with no assumption about the structure of the targets. Relevant protein descriptors in CG should allow one to learn how to dynamically adjust ligand attribute weights with respect to protein structure. Hence, models built through explicit learning (EL) by including protein information, while benefitting from IT enhancement, should provide additional predictive capability, notably for protein deorphanization. This interplay between IT and EL in CG modeling is not sufficiently studied. While IT is likely to occur irrespective of the injected target information, it is not clear whether and when boosting due to EL may occur. EL is only possible if protein description is appropriate to the target set under investigation. The key issue here is the search for evidence of genuine EL exceeding expectations based on pure IT. We explore the problem in the context of Support Vector Regression, using more than 9,400 pKi values of 31 GPCRs, where compound-protein interactions are represented by the concatenation of vectorial descriptions of compounds and proteins. This provides a unified framework to generate both IT-enhanced and potentially EL-enabled models, where the difference is toggled by supplied protein information. For EL-enabled models, protein information includes genuine protein descriptors such as typical sequence-based terms, but also the experimentally determined affinity cross-correlation fingerprints. These latter benchmark the expected behavior of a quasi-ideal descriptor capturing the actual functional protein-protein relatedness, and therefore thought to be the most likely to enable EL. EL- and IT-based methods were benchmarked alongside classical QSAR, with respect to cross-validation and deorphanization challenges. A rational method for projecting benchmarked methodologies into a strategy space is given, in the aims that the projection will provide directions for the types of molecule designs possible using a given methodology. While EL-enabled strategies outperform classical QSARs and favorably compare to similar published results, they are, in all respects evaluated herein, not strongly distinguished from IT-enhanced models. Moreover, EL-enabled strategies failed to prove superior in deorphanization challenges. Therefore, this paper raises caution that, contrary to common belief and intuitive expectation, the benefits of chemogenomics models over classical QSAR are quite possibly due less to the injection of protein-related information, and rather impacted more by the effect of inductive transfer, due to simultaneous learning from all of the modeled endpoints. These results show that the field of protein descriptor research needs further improvements to truly realize the expected benefit of EL.},

  Abstract                 = {Protein families involved in chromatin-templated events are emerging as novel target classes in oncology and other disease areas. The ability to discover selective inhibitors against chromatin factors depends on the presence of structural features that are unique to the targeted sites. To evaluate challenges and opportunities toward the development of selective inhibitors, we calculated all pair wise structural distances between 575 structures from the protein databank representing 163 unique binding pockets found in protein domains that write, read or erase post-translational modifications on histones, DNA, and RNA. We find that the structural similarity of binding sites does not always follow the sequence similarity of protein domains. Our analysis reveals increased risks of activity across target-class for compounds competing with the cofactor of protein arginine methyltransferases, lysine acetyltransferases, and sirtuins, while exploiting the conformational plasticity of a protein target is a path toward selective inhibition.

  Abstract                 = {Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for extracting features which preserve class separability. The projection vectors are commonly obtained by maximizing the between class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within class covariance. In practice, when there is no sufficient training samples, the covariance matrix of each class may not be accurately estimated. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Semi- supervised Discriminant Analysis (SDA), which makes use of both labeled and unlabeled samples. The labeled data points are used to maximize the separability between different classes and the unlabeled data points are used to estimate the intrinsic geometric structure of the data. Specifically, we aim to learn a discriminant function which is as smooth as possible on the data manifold. Experimental results on single training image face recognition and relevance feedback image retrieval demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Unfortunately, the current preclinical testing strategies, including the regulatory-required animal toxicity studies or simple in vitro tests, are insufficiently powered to predict DILI in patients reliably. Notably, the limited predictive power of such testing strategies is mostly attributed to the complex nature of DILI, a poor understanding of its mechanism, a scarcity of human hepatotoxicity data and inadequate bioinformatics capabilities. With the advent of high-content screening assays, toxicogenomics and bioinformatics, multiple end points can be studied simultaneously to improve prediction of clinically relevant DILIs. This review focuses on the current state of efforts in developing predictive models from diverse data sources for potential use in detecting human hepatotoxicity, and also aims to provide perspectives on how to further improve DILI prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is one of the leading causes of the termination of drug development programs. Consequently, identifying the risk of DILI in humans for drug candidates during the early stages of the development process would greatly reduce the drug attrition rate in the pharmaceutical industry but would require the implementation of new research and development strategies. In this regard, several in silico models have been proposed as alternative means in prioritizing drug candidates. Because the accuracy and utility of a predictive model rests largely on how to annotate the potential of a drug to cause DILI in a reliable and consistent way, the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug labeling was given prominence. Out of 387 drugs annotated, 197 drugs were used to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model and the model was subsequently challenged by the left of drugs serving as an external validation set with an overall prediction accuracy of 68.9\%. The performance of the model was further assessed by the use of 2 additional independent validation sets, and the 3 validation data sets have a total of 483 unique drugs. We observed that the QSAR model's performance varied for drugs with different therapeutic uses; however, it achieved a better estimated accuracy (73.6\%) as well as negative predictive value (77.0\%) when focusing only on these therapeutic categories with high prediction confidence. Thus, the model's applicability domain was defined. Taken collectively, the developed QSAR model has the potential utility to prioritize compound's risk for DILI in humans, particularly for the high-confidence therapeutic subgroups like analgesics, antibacterial agents, and antihistamines.},

Comparative analysis of drugs based on their DILI potential is an effective approach to discover key DILI mechanisms and risk factors.

We proposed a systematic classification scheme using FDA-approved drug labeling to assess the DILI potential of drugs, which yielded a benchmark dataset with 287 drugs representing a wide range of therapeutic categories and daily dosage amounts. The method is transparent and reproducible with a potential to serve as a common practice to study the DILI of marketed drugs for supporting drug discovery and biomarker development.},

  Abstract                 = {Cost-effective oligonucleotide genotyping arrays like the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 are still the predominant technique to measure DNA copy number variations (CNVs). However, CNV detection methods for microarrays overestimate both the number and the size of CNV regions and, consequently, suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR). A high FDR means that many CNVs are wrongly detected and therefore not associated with a disease in a clinical study, though correction for multiple testing takes them into account and thereby decreases the study's discovery power. For controlling the FDR, we propose a probabilistic latent variable model, 'cn.FARMS', which is optimized by a Bayesian maximum a posteriori approach. cn.FARMS controls the FDR through the information gain of the posterior over the prior. The prior represents the null hypothesis of copy number 2 for all samples from which the posterior can only deviate by strong and consistent signals in the data. On HapMap data, cn.FARMS clearly outperformed the two most prevalent methods with respect to sensitivity and FDR. The software cn.FARMS is publicly available as a R package at http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/cnfarms/cnfarms.html.},

In the present study, we present a method that uses probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) for this purpose, which is particularly useful for analyzing large interaction networks. DrugBank drugs clustered based on PMF latent variables show phenotypic similarity even in the absence of 3D shape similarity. Benchmarking computations show that the method outperforms those recently introduced provided that the input data set of known interactions is sufficiently large--which is the case for enzymes and ion channels, but not for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors. Runs performed on DrugBank after hiding 70\% of known interactions show that, on average, 88 of the top 100 predictions hit the hidden interactions. De novo predictions permit us to identify new potential interactions. Drug-target pairs implicated in neurobiological disorders are overrepresented among de novo predictions.},

The most significant obstacle associated with this approach is identification of the efficacy targets of small-molecule probes. The huge potential of chemical genetics cannot be realized without the establishment of reliable mechanisms for target identification. In this article, we describe each essential element of the chemical genetics process, discuss common challenges that the field is facing, and critically review various biochemical and genetics approaches recently developed for target deconvolution.

The analysis allowed us to establish a framework based on the five most important technical determinants of project success and pipeline quality, which we describe as the five 'R's: the right target, the right patient, the right tissue, the right safety and the right commercial potential. A sixth factor - the right culture - is also crucial in encouraging effective decision-making based on these technical determinants. AstraZeneca is currently applying this framework to guide its R&D teams, and although it is too early to demonstrate whether this has improved the company's R&D productivity, we present our data and analysis here in the hope that it may assist the industry overall in addressing this key challenge.},

  Abstract                 = {While increased attention is being paid to the impact of data quality in cell-line sensitivity and toxicology modeling, to date, no systematic study has evaluated the comparability of independent cytotoxicity measurements on a large-scale. Here, we estimate the experimental uncertainty of public cytotoxicity data from ChEMBL version 19. We applied stringent filtering criteria to assemble a curated data set comprised of pIC50 data for compound-cell line systems measured in independent laboratories. The estimated experimental uncertainty calculated was a mean unsigned error (MUE) value of 0.61-0.76, a median unsigned error (MedUE) value of 0.51-0.58, and a standard deviation of 0.76-1.00 pIC50 units. The experimental uncertainty (σE ) estimated from all pairs of cytotoxicity measurements with a ΔpIC50 value lower than 2.5 was found to be 0.59-0.77 pIC50 units, and thus 21-60 \% and 21-26 \% higher than that of pKi and pIC50 data for ligand-protein data (σE =0.47-0.48 pKi units and σE =0.57-0.61 pIC50 units, respectively). The estimated σE value from the pairs of pIC50 values measured with metabolic assays was 0.98, whereas the σE value was found to be 0.69 when using the 1388 pIC50 pairs measured using exactly the same experimental setup. The maximum achievable Pearson correlation coefficient (${R_{Pearson\;max.}^2 }$) of in silico models trained on cytotoxicity data from different laboratories was estimated to be 0.51-0.85, which is considerably different from the value of 1 corresponding to perfect predictions, hinting at the maximum performance one can expect also from computational cytotoxicity predictions. The lowest concordance between pairs of measurements was found for the drugs paclitaxel, methotrexate, zidovudine, and docetaxel, and for the cell lines HepG2, NCI-H460, L1210, and CCRF-CEM, hinting at particular sensitivity of those systems to experimental setups. The highest concordance was estimated for the compound-cell line system HL-60-etoposide (σE =0.70), whereas the lowest for L1210-methotrexate (σE =1.68). We found that annotation errors are responsible for the high discordance observed for some pairs of measurements, pointing out the importance of data curation when automatically extracting cytotoxicity data from public databases. Likewise, these results highlight the importance of estimating compound cytotoxicity with assays providing complementary biological information (i.e., metabolic, clonogenic and assays based on cell membrane integrity), especially when the mechanism of action of test compounds is unknown. From this analysis, guidelines can be created on the reliability of cytotoxicity data from public databases, which could ultimately prove valuable for modeling purposes, and to guide reporting of data in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {Predicting the best treatment strategy from genomic information is a core goal of precision medicine. Here we focus on predicting drug response based on a cohort of genomic, epigenomic and proteomic profiling data sets measured in human breast cancer cell lines. Through a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) project, we analyzed a total of 44 drug sensitivity prediction algorithms. The top-performing approaches modeled nonlinear relationships and incorporated biological pathway information. We found that gene expression microarrays consistently provided the best predictive power of the individual profiling data sets; however, performance was increased by including multiple, independent data sets. We discuss the innovations underlying the top-performing methodology, Bayesian multitask MKL, and we provide detailed descriptions of all methods. This study establishes benchmarks for drug sensitivity prediction and identifies approaches that can be leveraged for the development of new methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Genome-wide expression profiling is a powerful tool for implicating novel gene ensembles in cellular mechanisms of health and disease. The most popular platform for genome-wide expression profiling is the Affymetrix GeneChip. However, its selection of probes relied on earlier genome and transcriptome annotation which is significantly different from current knowledge. The resultant informatics problems have a profound impact on analysis and interpretation the data. Here, we address these critical issues and offer a solution. We identified several classes of problems at the individual probe level in the existing annotation, under the assumption that current genome and transcriptome databases are more accurate than those used for GeneChip design. We then reorganized probes on more than a dozen popular GeneChips into gene-, transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of up-to-date genome, cDNA/EST clustering and single nucleotide polymorphism information. Comparing analysis results between the original and the redefined probe sets reveals approximately 30-50\% discrepancy in the genes previously identified as differentially expressed, regardless of analysis method. Our results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many conclusions derived from past GeneChip analyses may be significantly flawed. It will be beneficial to re-analyze existing GeneChip data with updated probe set definitions.},

Our data show that, as a class, type II inhibitors are more selective than type I inhibitors, but that there are important exceptions to this trend. The data further illustrate that selective inhibitors have been developed against the majority of kinases targeted by the compounds tested. Analysis of the interaction patterns reveals a class of 'group-selective' inhibitors broadly active against a single subfamily of kinases, but selective outside that subfamily. The data set suggests compounds to use as tools to study kinases for which no dedicated inhibitors exist. It also provides a foundation for further exploring kinase inhibitor biology and toxicity, as well as for studying the structural basis of the observed interaction patterns. Our findings will help to realize the direct enabling potential of genomics for drug development and basic research about cellular signaling.},

  Abstract                 = {Endocrine disruptors (EDs) and their broad range of potential adverse effects in humans and other animals have been a concern for nearly two decades. Many putative EDs are widely used in commercial products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) such as food packaging materials, ingredients of cosmetics, medical and dental devices, and drugs. The Endocrine Disruptor Knowledge Base (EDKB) project was initiated in the mid 1990's by the FDA as a resource for the study of EDs. The EDKB database, a component of the project, contains data across multiple assay types for chemicals across a broad structural diversity. This paper demonstrates the utility of EDKB database, an integral part of the EDKB project, for understanding and prioritizing EDs for testing.The EDKB database currently contains 3,257 records of over 1,800 EDs from different assays including estrogen receptor binding, androgen receptor binding, uterotropic activity, cell proliferation, and reporter gene assays. Information for each compound such as chemical structure, assay type, potency, etc. is organized to enable efficient searching. A user-friendly interface provides rapid navigation, Boolean searches on EDs, and both spreadsheet and graphical displays for viewing results. The search engine implemented in the EDKB database enables searching by one or more of the following fields: chemical structure (including exact search and similarity search), name, molecular formula, CAS registration number, experiment source, molecular weight, etc. The data can be cross-linked to other publicly available and related databases including TOXNET, Cactus, ChemIDplus, ChemACX, Chem Finder, and NCI DTP.The EDKB database enables scientists and regulatory reviewers to quickly access ED data from multiple assays for specific or similar compounds. The data have been used to categorize chemicals according to potential risks for endocrine activity, thus providing a basis for prioritizing chemicals for more definitive but expensive testing. The EDKB database is publicly available and can be found online at http://edkb.fda.gov/webstart/edkb/index.html.},

A total of 22 compounds (∼6\% of the library) were found to inhibit FLuc with 10 compounds showing potencies ≤1 µM. Only two compounds were found to inhibit RLuc, and these showed relatively weak potency values (∼10 µM). An inhibitor series of the VEGFR2/TIE2 protein kinase family containing either an aryl oxazole or benzimidazole-urea core illustrate the different structure activity relationship profiles FLuc inhibitors can display for kinase inhibitor chemotypes. Several FLuc inhibitors were broadly active toward the tyrosine kinase and CDK families. These data should aid in interpreting the results derived from screens employing the GSK PKIS in cell-based assays using the FLuc reporter. The study also underscores the general need for strategies such as the use of orthogonal reporters to identify kinase or non-kinase mediated cellular responses.},

  Abstract                 = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract for which there are few safe and effective therapeutic options for long-term treatment and disease maintenance. Here, we applied a computational approach to discover new drug therapies for IBD in silico, using publicly available molecular data reporting gene expression in IBD samples and 164 small-molecule drug compounds. Among the top compounds predicted to be therapeutic for IBD by our approach were prednisolone, a corticosteroid used to treat IBD, and topiramate, an anticonvulsant drug not previously described to have efficacy for IBD or any related disorders of inflammation or the gastrointestinal tract. Using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced rodent model of IBD, we experimentally validated our topiramate prediction in vivo. Oral administration of topiramate significantly reduced gross pathological signs and microscopic damage in primary affected colon tissue in the TNBS-induced rodent model of IBD. These findings suggest that topiramate might serve as a therapeutic option for IBD in humans and support the use of public molecular data and computational approaches to discover new therapeutic options for disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Worldwide, the incidence of type 2 diabetes is rising rapidly, mainly because of the increase in the incidence of obesity, which is an important risk factor for this condition. Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are complex genetic traits but they also share some nongenetic risk factors. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and obesity might also partly be due to shared genes. By comparing all of the published genome scans for type 2 diabetes and obesity, five overlapping chromosomal regions for both diseases (encompassing 612 candidate genes) have been identified. By analysing these five susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes and obesity, using six freely available bioinformatics tools for disease gene identification, 27 functional candidate genes have been pinpointed that are involved in eating behaviour, metabolism and inflammation. These genes might reveal a molecular link between the two disorders.},

Several pieces of legislation have led to an increased interest in the use of in silico methods, specifically the formation of chemical categories for the assessment of toxicological endpoints. A key step in the development of chemical categories for genotoxicity is defining the organic chemistry associated with the formation of a covalent bond between DNA and an exogenous chemical. This organic chemistry is typically defined as structural alerts. To this end, this article has reviewed the literature defining the structural alerts associated with covalent DNA binding. Importantly, this review article also details the mechanistic organic chemistry associated with each of the structural alerts. This information is extremely important in terms of meeting regulatory requirements for the acceptance of the chemical category approach. The structural alerts and associated mechanistic chemistry have been incorporated into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (Q)SAR Application Toolbox.},

The assignment of compounds to a particular mechanism of action is important in the development and utilisation of (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) for ecotoxicity. Assignment to a mechanism can be difficult; however in 1992 Verhaar et al. published a series of structural rules which aimed to classify compounds according to mechanism of action. Recent interest has seen the Verhaar rules coded into freely available software such as Toxtree available from the European Chemicals Bureau. To date, a complete critical evaluation of these rules has been lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the Toxtree implementation of the Verhaar rules using two well characterised aquatic toxicity datasets (Pimephales promelas and Tetrahymena pyriformis phenol databases) for which mechanisms of toxic action are well established. The present study highlights rule, and possible coding, errors that may lead to misclassifications. Improvements to both the rules and prediction architecture are suggested. In particular further rules to improve predictions for polar narcosis (class 2) are suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The virtual screening of large compound databases is an important application of structural-activity relationship models. Due to the high structural diversity of these data sets, it is impossible for machine learning based QSAR models, which rely on a specific training set, to give reliable results for all compounds. Thus, it is important to consider the subset of the chemical space in which the model is applicable. The approaches to this problem that have been published so far mostly use vectorial descriptor representations to define this domain of applicability of the model. Unfortunately, these cannot be extended easily to structured kernel-based machine learning models. For this reason, we propose three approaches to estimate the domain of applicability of a kernel-based QSAR model. RESULTS: We evaluated three kernel-based applicability domain estimations using three different structured kernels on three virtual screening tasks. Each experiment consisted of the training of a kernel-based QSAR model using support vector regression and the ranking of a disjoint screening data set according to the predicted activity. For each prediction, the applicability of the model for the respective compound is quantitatively described using a score obtained by an applicability domain formulation. The suitability of the applicability domain estimation is evaluated by comparing the model performance on the subsets of the screening data sets obtained by different thresholds for the applicability scores. This comparison indicates that it is possible to separate the part of the chemspace, in which the model gives reliable predictions, from the part consisting of structures too dissimilar to the training set to apply the model successfully. A closer inspection reveals that the virtual screening performance of the model is considerably improved if half of the molecules, those with the lowest applicability scores, are omitted from the screening. CONCLUSION: The proposed applicability domain formulations for kernel-based QSAR models can successfully identify compounds for which no reliable predictions can be expected from the model. The resulting reduction of the search space and the elimination of some of the active compounds should not be considered as a drawback, because the results indicate that, in most cases, these omitted ligands would not be found by the model anyway.},

  Abstract                 = {Establishing quantitative relationships between molecular structure and broad biological effects has been a longstanding challenge in science. Currently, no method exists for forecasting broad biological activity profiles of medicinal agents even within narrow boundaries of structurally similar molecules. Starting from the premise that biological activity results from the capacity of small organic molecules to modulate the activity of the proteome, we set out to investigate whether descriptor sets could be developed for measuring and quantifying this molecular property. Using a 1,567-compound database, we show that percent inhibition values, determined at single high drug concentration in a battery of in vitro assays representing a cross section of the proteome, provide precise molecular property descriptors that identify the structure of molecules. When broad biological activity of molecules is represented in spectra form, organic molecules can be sorted by quantifying differences between biological spectra. Unlike traditional structure-activity relationship methods, sorting of molecules by using biospectra comparisons does not require knowledge of a molecule's putative drug targets. To illustrate this finding, we selected as starting point the biological activity spectra of clotrimazole and tioconazole because their putative target, lanosterol demethylase (CYP51), was not included in the bioassay array. Spectra similarity obtained through profile similarity measurements and hierarchical clustering provided an unbiased means for establishing quantitative relationships between chemical structures and biological activity spectra. This methodology, which we have termed biological spectra analysis, provides the capability not only of sorting molecules on the basis of biospectra similarity but also of predicting simultaneous interactions of new molecules with multiple proteins.},

Such "exemplars" can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called "affinity propagation," which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying interactions between drug compounds and target proteins has a great practical importance in the drug discovery process for known diseases. Existing databases contain very few experimentally validated drug-target interactions and formulating successful computational methods for predicting interactions remains challenging.In this study, we consider four different drug-target interaction networks from humans involving enzymes, ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. We then propose a novel Bayesian formulation that combines dimensionality reduction, matrix factorization and binary classification for predicting drug-target interaction networks using only chemical similarity between drug compounds and genomic similarity between target proteins. The novelty of our approach comes from the joint Bayesian formulation of projecting drug compounds and target proteins into a unified subspace using the similarities and estimating the interaction network in that subspace. We propose using a variational approximation in order to obtain an efficient inference scheme and give its detailed derivations. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in three different scenarios: (i) exploratory data analysis using low-dimensional projections, (ii) predicting interactions for the out-of-sample drug compounds and (iii) predicting unknown interactions of the given network.Software and Supplementary Material are available at http://users.ics.aalto.fi/gonen/kbmf2k.mehmet.gonen@aalto.fiSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {We extend kernelized matrix factorization with a full-Bayesian treatment and with an ability to work with multiple side information sources expressed as different kernels. Kernels have been introduced to integrate side information about the rows and columns, which is necessary for making out-of-matrix predictions. We discuss specifically binary output matrices but extensions to realvalued matrices are straightforward. We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A full-conjugate probabilistic formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization enables an efficient variational approximation, whereas full-Bayesian treatments are not computationally feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included, treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning which additionally reveals which side sources are informative. We then show that the framework can also be used for supervised and semi-supervised multilabel classification and multi-output regression, by considering samples and outputs as the domains where matrix factorization operates. Our method outperforms alternatives in predicting drug-protein interactions on two data sets. On multilabel classification, our algorithm obtains the lowest Hamming losses on 10 out of 14 data sets compared to five state-of-the-art multilabel classification algorithms. We finally show that the proposed approach outperforms alternatives in multi-output regression experiments on a yeast cell cycle data set.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug-induced liver injury is a major issue of concern and has led to the withdrawal of a significant number of marketed drugs. An understanding of structure-activity relationships (SARs) of chemicals can make a significant contribution to the identification of potential toxic effects early in the drug development process and aid in avoiding such problems. This process can be supported by the use of existing toxicity data and mechanistic understanding of the biological processes for related compounds. In the published literature, this information is often spread across diverse sources and can be varied and unstructured in quality and content. The current work has explored whether it is feasible to collect and use such data for the development of new SARs for the hepatotoxicity endpoint and expand upon the limited information currently available in this area. Reviews of hepatotoxicity data were used to build a structure-searchable database, which was analyzed to identify chemical classes associated with an adverse effect on the liver. Searches of the published literature were then undertaken to identify additional supporting evidence, and the resulting information was incorporated into the database. This collated information was evaluated and used to determine the scope of the SARs for each class identified. Data for over 1266 chemicals were collected, and SARs for 38 classes were developed. The SARs have been implemented as structural alerts using Derek for Windows (DfW), a knowledge-based expert system, to allow clearly supported and transparent predictions. An evaluation exercise performed using a customized DfW version 10 knowledge base demonstrated an overall concordance of 56\% and specificity and sensitivity values of 73\% and 46\%, respectively. The approach taken demonstrates that SARs for complex endpoints can be derived from the published data for use in the in silico toxicity assessment of new compounds.},

(2) The remaining compounds were clustered together with our in-house collection using a novel fingerprint-based clustering algorithm that emphasizes common substructures and works with millions of molecules. (3) Clusters populated exclusively by external compounds were identified as "diversity holes," and representative members of these clusters were presented to our global medicinal chemistry community, who were asked to specify which ones they liked, disliked, or were indifferent to using a simple point-and-click interface. (4) The resulting votes were used to rank the clusters from most to least desirable, and to prioritize which ones should be targeted for acquisition. Analysis of the voting results reveals interesting voter behaviors and distinct preferences for certain molecular property ranges that are fully consistent with lead-like profiles established through systematic analysis of large historical databases.},

In this paper we introduce one such method, binary kernel discrimination, and investigate its performance on two datasets; the first is a set of 1650 monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and the second a set of 101 437 compounds from an in-house enzyme assay. We compare the performance of binary kernel discrimination with a simple procedure which we call "merged similarity search", and also with a feedforward neural network. Binary kernel discrimination is shown to perform robustly with varying quantities of training data and also in the presence of noisy data. We conclude by highlighting the importance of the judicious use of general pattern recognition techniques for compound selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug repositioning applies established drugs to new disease indications with increasing success. A pre-requisite for drug repurposing is drug promiscuity (polypharmacology) - a drug's ability to bind to several targets. There is a long standing debate on the reasons for drug promiscuity. Based on large compound screens, hydrophobicity and molecular weight have been suggested as key reasons. However, the results are sometimes contradictory and leave space for further analysis. Protein structures offer a structural dimension to explain promiscuity: Can a drug bind multiple targets because the drug is flexible or because the targets are structurally similar or even share similar binding sites? We present a systematic study of drug promiscuity based on structural data of PDB target proteins with a set of 164 promiscuous drugs. We show that there is no correlation between the degree of promiscuity and ligand properties such as hydrophobicity or molecular weight but a weak correlation to conformational flexibility. However, we do find a correlation between promiscuity and structural similarity as well as binding site similarity of protein targets. In particular, 71\% of the drugs have at least two targets with similar binding sites. In order to overcome issues in detection of remotely similar binding sites, we employed a score for binding site similarity: LigandRMSD measures the similarity of the aligned ligands and uncovers remote local similarities in proteins. It can be applied to arbitrary structural binding site alignments. Three representative examples, namely the anti-cancer drug methotrexate, the natural product quercetin and the anti-diabetic drug acarbose are discussed in detail. Our findings suggest that global structural and binding site similarity play a more important role to explain the observed drug promiscuity in the PDB than physicochemical drug properties like hydrophobicity or molecular weight. Additionally, we find ligand flexibility to have a minor influence.},

In recent years a large number of publications have appeared in which docking tools are compared and evaluated for their effectiveness in virtual screening against a wide variety of protein targets. These studies have shown that the effectiveness of docking in virtual screening is highly variable due to a large number of possible confounding factors. Another class of method that has shown promise in virtual screening is the shape-based, ligand-centric approach. Several direct comparisons of docking with the shape-based tool ROCS have been conducted using data sets from some of these recent docking publications. The results show that a shape-based, ligand-centric approach is more consistent than, and often superior to, the protein-centric approach taken by docking.},

We calculated the similarities between hundreds of drug targets and their ligands and mapped the relationship between them in a formal network. Bioinformatics networks were based on the BLAST similarity between sequences, while chemoinformatics networks were based on the ligand-set similarities calculated with either the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) or a method derived from Bayesian statistics. By multiple criteria, bioinformatics and chemoinformatics networks differed substantially, and only occasionally did a high sequence similarity correspond to a high ligand-set similarity. In contrast, the chemoinformatics networks were stable to the method used to calculate the ligand-set similarities and to the chemical representation of the ligands. Also, the chemoinformatics networks were more natural and more organized, by network theory, than their bioinformatics counterparts: ligand-based networks were found to be small-world and broad-scale.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT:The decomposition of a chemical graph is a convenient approach to encode information of the corresponding organic compound. While several commercial toolkits exist to encode molecules as so-called fingerprints, only a few open source implementations are available. The aim of this work is to introduce a library for exactly defined molecular decompositions, with a strong focus on the application of these features in machine learning and data mining. It provides several options such as search depth, distance cut-offs, atom- and pharmacophore typing. Furthermore, it provides the functionality to combine, to compare, or to export the fingerprints into several formats.We provide a Java 1.6 library for the decomposition of chemical graphs based on the open source Chemistry Development Kit toolkit. We reimplemented popular fingerprinting algorithms such as depth-first search fingerprints, extended connectivity fingerprints, autocorrelation fingerprints (e.g. CATS2D), radial fingerprints (e.g. Molprint2D), geometrical Molprint, atom pairs, and pharmacophore fingerprints. We also implemented custom fingerprints such as the all-shortest path fingerprint that only includes the subset of shortest paths from the full set of paths of the depth-first search fingerprint. As an application of jCompoundMapper, we provide a command-line executable binary. We measured the conversion speed and number of features for each encoding and described the composition of the features in detail. The quality of the encodings was tested using the default parametrizations in combination with a support vector machine on the Sutherland QSAR data sets. Additionally, we benchmarked the fingerprint encodings on the large-scale Ames toxicity benchmark using a large-scale linear support vector machine. The results were promising and could often compete with literature results. On the large Ames benchmark, for example, we obtained an AUC ROC performance of 0.87 with a reimplementation of the extended connectivity fingerprint. This result is comparable to the performance achieved by a non-linear support vector machine using state-of-the-art descriptors. On the Sutherland QSAR data set, the best fingerprint encodings showed a comparable or better performance on 5 of the 8 benchmarks when compared against the results of the best descriptors published in the paper of Sutherland et al.jCompoundMapper is a library for chemical graph fingerprints with several tweaking possibilities and exporting options for open source data mining toolkits. The quality of the data mining results, the conversion speed, the LPGL software license, the command-line interface, and the exporters should be useful for many applications in cheminformatics like benchmarks against literature methods, comparison of data mining algorithms, similarity searching, and similarity-based data mining.},

Among a number of large-scale experiments for assigning certain functional classes to proteins, experiments determining protein-protein interaction are especially important because interacting proteins usually have the same function. Thus, it seems possible to predict the function of a protein when the function of its interacting partner is known. However, in vitro experiments often suffer from artifacts and a protein can often have multiple binding partners with different functions. We developed an objective prediction method that can systematically include the information of indirect interaction. Our method can predict the subcellular localization, the cellular role and the biochemical function of yeast proteins with accuracies of 72.7\%, 63.6\% and 52.7\%, respectively. The prediction accuracy rises for proteins with more than three binding partners and thus we present the open prediction results for 16 such proteins.},

Here the authors use the BioMAP human cell systems to characterize effects relevant to human tissue and inflammatory disease biology following exposure to the 320 environmental chemicals in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) ToxCast phase I library. The ToxCast chemicals were assayed at 4 concentrations in 8 BioMAP cell systems, with a total of 87 assay endpoints resulting in more than 100,000 data points. Within the context of the BioMAP database, ToxCast compounds could be classified based on their ability to cause overt cytotoxicity in primary human cell types or according to toxicity mechanism class derived from comparisons to activity profiles of BioMAP reference compounds. ToxCast chemicals with similarity to inducers of mitochondrial dysfunction, cAMP elevators, inhibitors of tubulin function, inducers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, or NFkappaB pathway inhibitors were identified based on this BioMAP analysis. This data set is being combined with additional ToxCast data sets for development of predictive toxicity models at the EPA.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, we have built a classification model that is capable of assigning a given sesquiterpene lactone (STL) into exactly one tribe of the plant family Asteraceae from which the STL has been isolated. Although many plant species are able to biosynthesize a set of peculiar compounds, the occurrence of the same secondary metabolites in more than one tribe of Asteraceae is frequent. Building on our previous work, in this paper, we explore the possibility of assigning an STL to more than one tribe (class) simultaneously. When an object may belong to more than one class simultaneously, it is called multilabeled. In this work, we present a general overview of the techniques available to examine multilabeled data. The problem of evaluating the performance of a multilabeled classifier is discussed. Two particular multilabeled classification methods-cross-training with support vector machines (ct-SVM) and multilabeled k-nearest neighbors (ML-kNN)-were applied to the classification of the STLs into seven tribes from the plant family Asteraceae. The results are compared to a single-label classification and are analyzed from a chemotaxonomic point of view. The multilabeled approach allowed us to (1) model the reality as closely as possible, (2) improve our understanding of the relationship between the secondary metabolite profiles of different Asteraceae tribes, and (3) significantly decrease the number of plant sources to be considered for finding a certain STL. The presented classification models are useful for the targeted collection of plants with the objective of finding plant sources of natural compounds that are biologically active or possess other specific properties of interest.},

Methods based on transcriptional responses require the least amount of information and can be quickly applied to new compounds. Available methods are inefficient and are not able to support network pharmacology. We developed an automatic and robust approach that exploits similarity in gene expression profiles following drug treatment, across multiple cell lines and dosages, to predict similarities in drug effect and MoA. We constructed a "drug network" of 1,302 nodes (drugs) and 41,047 edges (indicating similarities between pair of drugs). We applied network theory, partitioning drugs into groups of densely interconnected nodes (i.e., communities). These communities are significantly enriched for compounds with similar MoA, or acting on the same pathway, and can be used to identify the compound-targeted biological pathways. New compounds can be integrated into the network to predict their therapeutic and off-target effects. Using this network, we correctly predicted the MoA for nine anticancer compounds, and we were able to discover an unreported effect for a well-known drug. We verified an unexpected similarity between cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitors and Topoisomerase inhibitors. We discovered that Fasudil (a Rho-kinase inhibitor) might be "repositioned" as an enhancer of cellular autophagy, potentially applicable to several neurodegenerative disorders. Our approach was implemented in a tool (Mode of Action by NeTwoRk Analysis, MANTRA, http://mantra.tigem.it).},

  Abstract                 = {Enhancing autophagy is a potentially effective strategy for the treatment of several human disorders. Therefore, there is a great effort in developing drugs modulating autophagy, and various approaches have been taken towards this goal. Gene expression has been considered an important biomarker for drug activity for prediction of drug mode of action. However, the lack of efficient method of analysis has hampered recognition of drug mode of action based on the analysis of gene expression profiles. A novel and robust tool for prediction of drug mode of action and drug repositioning overcomes the limitations of previously available methods. This novel tool is based on a data set of expression profiles derived from a large number of drugs integrated into a "drug network" constructed by comparing the transcriptional responses induced in human cell lines. Automatic analysis of the topology of the drug network makes it possible to classify compounds and to predict unreported effects of well-known drugs. Using this tool, it was possible to identify fasudil as a new enhancer of autophagy.},

These networks are derived from different sources of experimental data, or literature-based analysis, and provide a complementary view of drug mode of action.

Attempts to use gene expression data in mammalian systems have so far met limited success. Here, we built a drug similarity network starting from a public reference dataset containing genome-wide gene expression profiles (GEPs) following treatments with more than a thousand compounds. In this network, drugs sharing a subset of molecular targets are connected by an edge or lie in the same community. Our approach is based on a novel similarity distance between two compounds. The distance is computed by combining GEPs via an original rank-aggregation method, followed by a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to compute similarity between pair of drugs. The network is obtained by considering each compound as a node, and adding an edge between two compounds if their similarity distance is below a given significance threshold. We show that, despite the complexity and the variety of the experimental conditions, our approach is able to identify similarities in drug mode of action from GEPs. Our approach can also be used for the identification of the MOA of new compounds.},

  Abstract                 = {The AMBIT web services package is one of the several existing independent implementations of the OpenTox Application Programming Interface and is built according to the principles of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. The Open Source Predictive Toxicology Framework, developed by the partners in the EC FP7 OpenTox project, aims at providing a unified access to toxicity data and predictive models, as well as validation procedures. This is achieved by i) an information model, based on a common OWL-DL ontology ii) links to related ontologies; iii) data and algorithms, available through a standardized REST web services interface, where every compound, data set or predictive method has a unique web address, used to retrieve its Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation, or initiate the associated calculations.The AMBIT web services package has been developed as an extension of AMBIT modules, adding the ability to create (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models and providing an OpenTox API compliant interface. The representation of data and processing resources in W3C Resource Description Framework facilitates integrating the resources as Linked Data. By uploading datasets with chemical structures and arbitrary set of properties, they become automatically available online in several formats. The services provide unified interfaces to several descriptor calculation, machine learning and similarity searching algorithms, as well as to applicability domain and toxicity prediction models. All Toxtree modules for predicting the toxicological hazard of chemical compounds are also integrated within this package. The complexity and diversity of the processing is reduced to the simple paradigm "read data from a web address, perform processing, write to a web address". The online service allows to easily run predictions, without installing any software, as well to share online datasets and models. The downloadable web application allows researchers to setup an arbitrary number of service instances for specific purposes and at suitable locations. These services could be used as a distributed framework for processing of resource-intensive tasks and data sharing or in a fully independent way, according to the specific needs. The advantage of exposing the functionality via the OpenTox API is seamless interoperability, not only within a single web application, but also in a network of distributed services. Last, but not least, the services provide a basis for building web mashups, end user applications with friendly GUIs, as well as embedding the functionalities in existing workflow systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug discovery and development has been aided by high throughput screening methods that detect compound effects on a single target. However, when using focused initial screening, undesirable secondary effects are often detected late in the development process after significant investment has been made. An alternative approach would be to screen against undesired effects early in the process, but the number of possible secondary targets makes this prohibitively expensive.This paper describes methods for making this global approach practical by constructing predictive models for many target responses to many compounds and using them to guide experimentation. We demonstrate for the first time that by jointly modeling targets and compounds using descriptive features and using active machine learning methods, accurate models can be built by doing only a small fraction of possible experiments. The methods were evaluated by computational experiments using a dataset of 177 assays and 20,000 compounds constructed from the PubChem database.An average of nearly 60\% of all hits in the dataset were found after exploring only 3\% of the experimental space which suggests that active learning can be used to enable more complete characterization of compound effects than otherwise affordable. The methods described are also likely to find widespread application outside drug discovery, such as for characterizing the effects of a large number of compounds or inhibitory RNAs on a large number of cell or tissue phenotypes.},

  Abstract                 = {Mutagenicity is one of the numerous adverse properties of a compound that hampers its potential to become a marketable drug. Toxic properties can often be related to chemical structure, more specifically, to particular substructures, which are generally identified as toxicophores. A number of toxicophores have already been identified in the literature. This study aims at increasing the current degree of reliability and accuracy of mutagenicity predictions by identifying novel toxicophores from the application of new criteria for toxicophore rule derivation and validation to a considerably sized mutagenicity dataset. For this purpose, a dataset of 4337 molecular structures with corresponding Ames test data (2401 mutagens and 1936 nonmutagens) was constructed. An initial substructure-search of this dataset showed that most mutagens were detected by applying only eight general toxicophores. From these eight, more specific toxicophores were derived and approved by employing chemical and mechanistic knowledge in combination with statistical criteria. A final set of 29 toxicophores containing new substructures was assembled that could classify the mutagenicity of the investigated dataset with a total classification error of 18\%. Furthermore, mutagenicity predictions of an independent validation set of 535 compounds were performed with an error percentage of 15\%. Since these error percentages approach the average interlaboratory reproducibility error of Ames tests, which is 15\%, it was concluded that these toxicophores can be applied to risk assessment processes and can guide the design of chemical libraries for hit and lead optimization.},

Here we consider a complementary technique that quantitatively groups and relates proteins based on the chemical similarity of their ligands. We began with 65,000 ligands annotated into sets for hundreds of drug targets. The similarity score between each set was calculated using ligand topology. A statistical model was developed to rank the significance of the resulting similarity scores, which are expressed as a minimum spanning tree to map the sets together. Although these maps are connected solely by chemical similarity, biologically sensible clusters nevertheless emerged. Links among unexpected targets also emerged, among them that methadone, emetine and loperamide (Imodium) may antagonize muscarinic M3, alpha2 adrenergic and neurokinin NK2 receptors, respectively. These predictions were subsequently confirmed experimentally. Relating receptors by ligand chemistry organizes biology to reveal unexpected relationships that may be assayed using the ligands themselves.},

Chemical similarities between drugs and ligand sets predicted thousands of unanticipated associations. Thirty were tested experimentally, including the antagonism of the beta(1) receptor by the transporter inhibitor Prozac, the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter by the ion channel drug Vadilex, and antagonism of the histamine H(4) receptor by the enzyme inhibitor Rescriptor. Overall, 23 new drug-target associations were confirmed, five of which were potent (<100 nM). The physiological relevance of one, the drug N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on serotonergic receptors, was confirmed in a knockout mouse. The chemical similarity approach is systematic and comprehensive, and may suggest side-effects and new indications for many drugs.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of relationships of drug structure to biological response is key to understanding off-target and unexpected drug effects, and for developing hypotheses on how to tailor drug therapies. New methods are required for integrated analyses of a large number of chemical features of drugs against the corresponding genome-wide responses of multiple cell models.In this article, we present the first comprehensive multi-set analysis on how the chemical structure of drugs impacts on genome-wide gene expression across several cancer cell lines [Connectivity Map (CMap) database]. The task is formulated as searching for drug response components across multiple cancers to reveal shared effects of drugs and the chemical features that may be responsible. The components can be computed with an extension of a recent approach called Group Factor Analysis. We identify 11 components that link the structural descriptors of drugs with specific gene expression responses observed in the three cell lines and identify structural groups that may be responsible for the responses. Our method quantitatively outperforms the limited earlier methods on CMap and identifies both the previously reported associations and several interesting novel findings, by taking into account multiple cell lines and advanced 3D structural descriptors. The novel observations include: previously unknown similarities in the effects induced by 15-delta prostaglandin J2 and HSP90 inhibitors, which are linked to the 3D descriptors of the drugs; and the induction by simvastatin of leukemia-specific response, resembling the effects of corticosteroids.Source Code implementing the method is available at: http://research.ics.aalto.fi/mi/software/GFAsparse.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {The balance between Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells critically modulates immune homeostasis, with an inadequate Treg response contributing to inflammatory disease. Using an unbiased chemical biology approach, we identified a novel role for the dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase DYRK1A in regulating this balance. Inhibition of DYRK1A enhances Treg differentiation and impairs Th17 differentiation without affecting known pathways of Treg/Th17 differentiation. Thus, DYRK1A represents a novel mechanistic node at the branch point between commitment to either Treg or Th17 lineages. Importantly, both Treg cells generated using the DYRK1A inhibitor harmine and direct administration of harmine itself potently attenuate inflammation in multiple experimental models of systemic autoimmunity and mucosal inflammation. Our results identify DYRK1A as a physiologically relevant regulator of Treg cell differentiation and suggest a broader role for other DYRK family members in immune homeostasis. These results are discussed in the context of human diseases associated with dysregulated DYRK activity.},

Here we evaluated one component of the ToxCast program, the use of primary human cell systems, by screening for chemicals that disrupt physiologically important pathways. Chemical-response signatures for 87 endpoints covering molecular functions relevant to toxic and therapeutic pathways were generated in eight cell systems for 641 environmental chemicals and 135 reference pharmaceuticals and failed drugs. Computational clustering of the profiling data provided insights into the polypharmacology and potential off-target effects for many chemicals that have limited or no toxicity information. The endpoints measured can be closely linked to in vivo outcomes, such as the upregulation of tissue factor in endothelial cell systems by compounds linked to the risk of thrombosis in vivo. Our results demonstrate that assaying complex biological pathways in primary human cells can identify potential chemical targets, toxicological liabilities and mechanisms useful for elucidating adverse outcome pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {Polypharmacology, which focuses on designing drugs that bind efficiently to multiple targets, has emerged as a new strategic trend in today's drug discovery research. Many successful drugs achieve their effects via multi-target interactions. However, these targets are largely unknown for both marketed drugs and drugs in development. A better knowledge of a drug's mode of action could be of substantial value to future drug development, in particular for side effect prediction and drug repositioning. We propose a network-based computational method for drug target prediction, applicable on a genome-wide scale. Our approach relies on the analysis of gene expression following drug treatment in the context of a functional protein association network. By diffusing differential expression signals to neighboring or correlated nodes in the network, genes are prioritized as potential targets based on the transcriptional response of functionally related genes. Different diffusion strategies were evaluated on 235 publicly available gene expression datasets for treatment with bioactive molecules having a known target. AUC values of up to more than 90\% demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and indicate the predictive power of integrating experimental gene expression data with prior knowledge from protein association networks.},

Surprisingly, more first-in-class small-molecule drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1999 and 2008 were identified by functional phenotypic lead generation strategies reminiscent of pre-genomics pharmacology than contemporary molecular targeted strategies that encompass the vast majority of lead generation efforts. This observation, in conjunction with the difficulty in validating molecular targets for drug discovery, has diminished the impact of the "genomics revolution" and has led to a growing grassroots movement and now broader trend in pharma to reconsider the use of modern physiology-based or phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) strategies. This "From the Guest Editors" column provides an introduction and overview of the two-part special issues of Journal of Biomolecular Screening on PDD. Terminology and the business case for use of PDD are defined. Key issues such as assay performance, chemical optimization, target identification, and challenges to the organization and implementation of PDD are discussed. Possible solutions for these challenges and a new neoclassic vision for PDD that combines phenotypic and functional approaches with technology innovations resulting from the genomics-driven era of target-based drug discovery (TDD) are also described. Finally, an overview of the manuscripts in this special edition is provided.},

The database currently contains over 2900 small molecule and peptide toxins, 1300 toxin-targets and more than 33,000 toxin-target associations. Each T3DB record (ToxCard) contains over 80 data fields providing detailed information on chemical properties and descriptors, toxicity values, protein and gene sequences (for both targets and toxins), molecular and cellular interaction data, toxicological data, mechanistic information and references. This information has been manually extracted and manually verified from numerous sources, including other electronic databases, government documents, textbooks and scientific journals. A key focus of the T3DB is on providing 'depth' over 'breadth' with detailed descriptions, mechanisms of action, and information on toxins and toxin-targets. T3DB is fully searchable and supports extensive text, sequence, chemical structure and relational query searches, similar to those found in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and DrugBank. Potential applications of the T3DB include clinical metabolomics, toxin target prediction, toxicity prediction and toxicology education. The T3DB is available online at http://www.t3db.org.},

  Abstract                 = {Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, and 1A2 are the most important drug-metabolizing enzymes in the human liver. Knowledge of which parts of a drug molecule are subject to metabolic reactions catalyzed by these enzymes is crucial for rational drug design to mitigate ADME/toxicity issues. SMARTCyp, a recently developed 2D ligand structure-based method, is able to predict site-specific metabolic reactivity of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with an accuracy that rivals the best and more computationally demanding 3D structure-based methods. In this article, the SMARTCyp approach was extended to predict the metabolic hotspots for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2 substrates. This was accomplished by taking into account the impact of a key substrate-receptor recognition feature of each enzyme as a correction term to the SMARTCyp reactivity. The corrected reactivity was then used to rank order the likely sites of CYP-mediated metabolic reactions. For 60 CYP1A2 substrates, the observed major sites of CYP1A2 catalyzed metabolic reactions were among the top-ranked 1, 2, and 3 positions in 67\%, 80\%, and 83\% of the cases, respectively. The results were similar to those obtained by MetaSite and the reactivity + docking approach. For 70 CYP2C9 substrates, the observed sites of CYP2C9 metabolism were among the top-ranked 1, 2, and 3 positions in 66\%, 86\%, and 87\% of the cases, respectively. These results were better than the corresponding results of StarDrop version 5.0, which were 61\%, 73\%, and 77\%, respectively. For 36 compounds metabolized by CYP2C19, the observed sites of metabolism were found to be among the top-ranked 1, 2, and 3 sites in 78\%, 89\%, and 94\% of the cases, respectively. The computational procedure was implemented as an extension to the program SMARTCyp 2.0. With the extension, the program can now predict the site of metabolism for all five major drug-metabolizing enzymes with an accuracy similar to or better than that achieved by the best 3D structure-based methods. Both the Java source code and the binary executable of the program are freely available to interested users.},

  Abstract                 = {The molecular mechanism of many drug side-effects is unknown and difficult to predict. Previous methods for explaining side-effects have focused on known drug targets and their pathways. However, low affinity binding to proteins that are not usually considered drug targets may also drive side-effects. In order to assess these alternative targets, we used the 3D structures of 563 essential human proteins systematically to predict binding to 216 drugs. We first benchmarked our affinity predictions with available experimental data. We then combined singular value decomposition and canonical component analysis (SVD-CCA) to predict side-effects based on these novel target profiles. Our method predicts side-effects with good accuracy (average AUC: 0.82 for side effects present in <50\% of drug labels). We also noted that side-effect frequency is the most important feature for prediction and can confound efforts at elucidating mechanism; our method allows us to remove the contribution of frequency and isolate novel biological signals. In particular, our analysis produces 2768 triplet associations between 50 essential proteins, 99 drugs, and 77 side-effects. Although experimental validation is difficult because many of our essential proteins do not have validated assays, we nevertheless attempted to validate a subset of these associations using experimental assay data. Our focus on essential proteins allows us to find potential associations that would likely be missed if we used recognized drug targets. Our associations provide novel insights about the molecular mechanisms of drug side-effects and highlight the need for expanded experimental efforts to investigate drug binding to proteins more broadly.},

  Abstract                 = {In pharmaceutical sciences, a crucial step of the drug discovery process is the identification of drug-target interactions. However, only a small portion of the drug-target interactions have been experimentally validated, as the experimental validation is laborious and costly. To improve the drug discovery efficiency, there is a great need for the development of accurate computational approaches that can predict potential drug-target interactions to direct the experimental verification. In this paper, we propose a novel drug-target interaction prediction algorithm, namely neighborhood regularized logistic matrix factorization (NRLMF). Specifically, the proposed NRLMF method focuses on modeling the probability that a drug would interact with a target by logistic matrix factorization, where the properties of drugs and targets are represented by drug-specific and target-specific latent vectors, respectively. Moreover, NRLMF assigns higher importance levels to positive observations (i.e., the observed interacting drug-target pairs) than negative observations (i.e., the unknown pairs). Because the positive observations are already experimentally verified, they are usually more trustworthy. Furthermore, the local structure of the drug-target interaction data has also been exploited via neighborhood regularization to achieve better prediction accuracy. We conducted extensive experiments over four benchmark datasets, and NRLMF demonstrated its effectiveness compared with five state-of-the-art approaches.},

Recently, image-based profiling has shown promise as a means for broadly characterizing molecules' effects on cells in several drug-discovery applications, including target-agnostic screening and predicting a compound's mechanism of action (MOA). Several profiling methods have been proposed, but little is known about their comparative performance, impeding the wider adoption and further development of image-based profiling. We compared these methods by applying them to a widely applicable assay of cultured cells and measuring the ability of each method to predict the MOA of a compendium of drugs. A very simple method that is based on population means performed as well as methods designed to take advantage of the measurements of individual cells. This is surprising because many treatments induced a heterogeneous phenotypic response across the cell population in each sample. Another simple method, which performs factor analysis on the cellular measurements before averaging them, provided substantial improvement and was able to predict MOA correctly for 94\% of the treatments in our ground-truth set. To facilitate the ready application and future development of image-based phenotypic profiling methods, we provide our complete ground-truth and test data sets, as well as open-source implementations of the various methods in a common software framework.},

  Abstract                 = {Target identification is one of the most critical steps following cell-based phenotypic chemical screens aimed at identifying compounds with potential uses in cell biology and for developing novel disease therapies. Current in silico target identification methods, including chemical similarity database searches, are limited to single or sequential ligand analysis that have limited capabilities for accurate deconvolution of a large number of compounds with diverse chemical structures. Here, we present CSNAP (Chemical Similarity Network Analysis Pulldown), a new computational target identification method that utilizes chemical similarity networks for large-scale chemotype (consensus chemical pattern) recognition and drug target profiling. Our benchmark study showed that CSNAP can achieve an overall higher accuracy (>80\%) of target prediction with respect to representative chemotypes in large (>200) compound sets, in comparison to the SEA approach (60-70\%). Additionally, CSNAP is capable of integrating with biological knowledge-based databases (Uniprot, GO) and high-throughput biology platforms (proteomic, genetic, etc) for system-wise drug target validation. To demonstrate the utility of the CSNAP approach, we combined CSNAP's target prediction with experimental ligand evaluation to identify the major mitotic targets of hit compounds from a cell-based chemical screen and we highlight novel compounds targeting microtubules, an important cancer therapeutic target. The CSNAP method is freely available and can be accessed from the CSNAP web server (http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/CSNAP/).},

It is characterized by the excess accumulation of phospholipids and is most reliably identified by electron microscopy of cells revealing the presence of lamellar inclusion bodies. The development of phospholipidosis can cause a delay in the drug development process, and the importance of computational approaches to the problem has been well documented. Previous work on predictive methods for phospholipidosis showed that state of the art machine learning methods produced the best results. Here we extend this work by looking at a larger data set mined from the literature. We find that circular fingerprints lead to better models than either E-Dragon descriptors or a combination of the two. We also observe very similar performance in general between Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models.},

Unfortunately, being linear combinations of up to all the data points, these vectors are notoriously difficult to interpret in terms of the data and processes generating the data. In this article, we develop CUR matrix decompositions for improved data analysis. CUR decompositions are low-rank matrix decompositions that are explicitly expressed in terms of a small number of actual columns and/or actual rows of the data matrix. Because they are constructed from actual data elements, CUR decompositions are interpretable by practitioners of the field from which the data are drawn (to the extent that the original data are). We present an algorithm that preferentially chooses columns and rows that exhibit high "statistical leverage" and, thus, in a very precise statistical sense, exert a disproportionately large "influence" on the best low-rank fit of the data matrix. By selecting columns and rows in this manner, we obtain improved relative-error and constant-factor approximation guarantees in worst-case analysis, as opposed to the much coarser additive-error guarantees of prior work. In addition, since the construction involves computing quantities with a natural and widely studied statistical interpretation, we can leverage ideas from diagnostic regression analysis to employ these matrix decompositions for exploratory data analysis.},

This challenge comprised 12,000 environmental chemicals and drugs which were measured for 12 different toxic effects by specifically designed assays. We participated in this challenge to assess the performance of Deep Learning in computational toxicity prediction. Deep Learning has already revolutionized image processing, speech recognition, and language understanding but has not yet been applied to computational toxicity. Deep Learning is founded on novel algorithms and architectures for artificial neural networks together with the recent availability of very fast computers and massive datasets. It discovers multiple levels of distributed representations of the input, with higher levels representing more abstract concepts. We hypothesized that the construction of a hierarchy of chemical features gives Deep Learning the edge over other toxicity prediction methods. Furthermore, Deep Learning naturally enables multi-task learning, that is, learning of all toxic effects in one neural network and thereby learning of highly informative chemical features.

In order to utilize Deep Learning for toxicity prediction, we have developed the DeepTox pipeline. First, DeepTox normalizes the chemical representations of the compounds. Then it computes a large number of chemical descriptors that are used as input to machine learning methods. In its next step, DeepTox trains models, evaluates them, and combines the best of them to ensembles. Finally, DeepTox predicts the toxicity of new compounds. In the Tox21 Data Challenge, DeepTox had the highest performance of all computational methods winning the grand challenge, the nuclear receptor panel, the stress response panel, and six single assays (teams ``Bioinf@JKU''). We found that Deep Learning excelled in toxicity prediction and outperformed many other computational approaches like naive Bayes, support vector machines, and random forests.},

  Abstract                 = {Connectivity mapping is a recently developed technique for discovering the underlying connections between different biological states based on gene-expression similarities. The sscMap method has been shown to provide enhanced sensitivity in mapping meaningful connections leading to testable biological hypotheses and in identifying drug candidates with particular pharmacological and/or toxicological properties. Challenges remain, however, as to how to prioritise the large number of discovered connections in an unbiased manner such that the success rate of any following-up investigation can be maximised. We introduce a new concept, gene-signature perturbation, which aims to test whether an identified connection is stable enough against systematic minor changes (perturbation) to the gene-signature. We applied the perturbation method to three independent datasets obtained from the GEO database: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cervical cancer, and breast cancer treated with letrozole. We demonstrate that the perturbation approach helps to identify meaningful biological connections which suggest the most relevant candidate drugs. In the case of AML, we found that the prevalent compounds were retinoic acids and PPAR activators. For cervical cancer, our results suggested that potential drugs are likely to involve the EGFR pathway; and with the breast cancer dataset, we identified candidates that are involved in prostaglandin inhibition. Thus the gene-signature perturbation approach added real values to the whole connectivity mapping process, allowing for increased specificity in the identification of possible therapeutic candidates.},

  Abstract                 = {Predicting the response of a specific cancer to a therapy is a major goal in modern oncology that should ultimately lead to a personalised treatment. High-throughput screenings of potentially active compounds against a panel of genomically heterogeneous cancer cell lines have unveiled multiple relationships between genomic alterations and drug responses. Various computational approaches have been proposed to predict sensitivity based on genomic features, while others have used the chemical properties of the drugs to ascertain their effect. In an effort to integrate these complementary approaches, we developed machine learning models to predict the response of cancer cell lines to drug treatment, quantified through IC₅₀ values, based on both the genomic features of the cell lines and the chemical properties of the considered drugs. Models predicted IC₅₀ values in a 8-fold cross-validation and an independent blind test with coefficient of determination R² of 0.72 and 0.64 respectively. Furthermore, models were able to predict with comparable accuracy (R² of 0.61) IC50s of cell lines from a tissue not used in the training stage. Our in silico models can be used to optimise the experimental design of drug-cell screenings by estimating a large proportion of missing IC₅₀ values rather than experimentally measuring them. The implications of our results go beyond virtual drug screening design: potentially thousands of drugs could be probed in silico to systematically test their potential efficacy as anti-tumour agents based on their structure, thus providing a computational framework to identify new drug repositioning opportunities as well as ultimately be useful for personalized medicine by linking the genomic traits of patients to drug sensitivity.},

  Abstract                 = {In silico analyses are increasingly being used to support mode-of-action investigations; however many such approaches do not utilise the large amounts of inactive data held in chemogenomic repositories. The objective of this work is concerned with the integration of such bioactivity data in the target prediction of orphan compounds to produce the probability of activity and inactivity for a range of targets. To this end, a novel human bioactivity data set was constructed through the assimilation of over 195 million bioactivity data points deposited in the ChEMBL and PubChem repositories, and the subsequent application of a sphere-exclusion selection algorithm to oversample presumed inactive compounds.A Bernoulli Naïve Bayes algorithm was trained using the data and evaluated using fivefold cross-validation, achieving a mean recall and precision of 67.7 and 63.8 \% for active compounds and 99.6 and 99.7 \% for inactive compounds, respectively. We show the performances of the models are considerably influenced by the underlying intraclass training similarity, the size of a given class of compounds, and the degree of additional oversampling. The method was also validated using compounds extracted from WOMBAT producing average precision-recall AUC and BEDROC scores of 0.56 and 0.85, respectively. Inactive data points used for this test are based on presumed inactivity, producing an approximated indication of the true extrapolative ability of the models. A distance-based applicability domain analysis was also conducted; indicating an average Tanimoto Coefficient distance of 0.3 or greater between a test and training set can be used to give a global measure of confidence in model predictions. A final comparison to a method trained solely on active data from ChEMBL performed with precision-recall AUC and BEDROC scores of 0.45 and 0.76.The inclusion of inactive data for model training produces models with superior AUC and improved early recognition capabilities, although the results from internal and external validation of the models show differing performance between the breadth of models. The realised target prediction protocol is available at https://github.com/lhm30/PIDGIN.Graphical abstractThe inclusion of large scale negative training data for in silico target prediction improves the precision and recall AUC and BEDROC scores for target models.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda have been used in humans for thousands of years. While the link to a particular indication has been established in man, the mode-of-action (MOA) of the formulations often remains unknown. In this study, we aim to understand the MOA of formulations used in traditional medicine using an in silico target prediction algorithm, which aims to predict protein targets (and hence MOAs), given the chemical structure of a compound. Following this approach we were able to establish several links between suggested MOAs and experimental evidence. In particular, compounds from the 'tonifying and replenishing medicinal' class from TCM exhibit a hypoglycemic effect which can be related to activity of the ingredients against the Sodium-Glucose Transporters (SGLT) 1 and 2 as well as Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP). Similar results were obtained for Ayurvedic anticancer drugs. Here, both primary anticancer targets (those directly involved in cancer pathogenesis) such as steroid-5-alpha-reductase 1 and 2 were predicted as well as targets which act synergistically with the primary target, such as the efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In addition, we were able to elucidate some targets which may point us to novel MOAs as well as explain side effects. Most notably, GPBAR1, which was predicted as a target for both 'tonifying and replenishing medicinal' and anticancer classes, suggests an influence of the compounds on metabolism. Understanding the MOA of these compounds is beneficial as it provides a resource for NMEs with possibly higher efficacy in the clinic than those identified by single-target biochemical assays.},

  Abstract                 = {In a recent paper, Mussa, Mitchell and Glen (MMG) have mathematically demonstrated that the "Laplacian Corrected Modified Naïve Bayes" (LCMNB) algorithm can be viewed as a variant of the so-called Standard Naïve Bayes (SNB) scheme, whereby the role played by absence of compound features in classifying/assigning the compound to its appropriate class is ignored. MMG have also proffered guidelines regarding the conditions under which this omission may hold. Utilising three data sets, the present paper examines the validity of these guidelines in practice. The paper also extends MMG's work and introduces a new version of the SNB classifier: "Tapered Naïve Bayes" (TNB). TNB does not discard the role of absence of a feature out of hand, nor does it fully consider its role. Hence, TNB encapsulates both SNB and LCMNB.LCMNB, SNB and TNB performed differently on classifying 4,658, 5,031 and 1,149 ligands (all chosen from the ChEMBL Database) distributed over 31 enzymes, 23 membrane receptors, and one ion-channel, four transporters and one transcription factor as their target proteins. When the number of features utilised was equal to or smaller than the "optimal" number of features for a given data set, SNB classifiers systematically gave better classification results than those yielded by LCMNB classifiers. The opposite was true when the number of features employed was markedly larger than the "optimal" number of features for this data set. Nonetheless, these LCMNB performances were worse than the classification performance achieved by SNB when the "optimal" number of features for the data set was utilised. TNB classifiers systematically outperformed both SNB and LCMNB classifiers.The classification results obtained in this study concur with the mathematical based guidelines given in MMG's paper-that is, ignoring the role of absence of a feature out of hand does not necessarily improve classification performance of the SNB approach; if anything, it could make the performance of the SNB method worse. The results obtained also lend support to the rationale, on which the TNB algorithm rests: handled judiciously, taking into account absence of features can enhance (not impair) the discriminatory classification power of the SNB approach.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last decade the standard Naive Bayes (SNB) algorithm has been widely employed in multi-class classification problems in cheminformatics. This popularity is mainly due to the fact that the algorithm is simple to implement and in many cases yields respectable classification results. Using clever heuristic arguments "anchored" by insightful cheminformatics knowledge, Xia et al. have simplified the SNB algorithm further and termed it the Laplacian Corrected Modified Naive Bayes (LCMNB) approach, which has been widely used in cheminformatics since its publication.In this note we mathematically illustrate the conditions under which Xia et al.'s simplification holds. It is our hope that this clarification could help Naive Bayes practitioners in deciding when it is appropriate to employ the LCMNB algorithm to classify large chemical datasets.A general formulation that subsumes the simplified Naive Bayes version is presented. Unlike the widely used NB method, the Standard Naive Bayes description presented in this work is discriminative (not generative) in nature, which may lead to possible further applications of the SNB method.Starting from a standard Naive Bayes (SNB) algorithm, we have derived mathematically the relationship between Xia et al.'s ingenious, but heuristic algorithm, and the SNB approach. We have also demonstrated the conditions under which Xia et al.'s crucial assumptions hold. We therefore hope that the new insight and recommendations provided can be found useful by the cheminformatics community.},

The size and the complexity of the screens have been steadily increasing. This is reflected in the fact that the major challenges facing the field at the present are data mining and data storage due to the large amount of data generated during HCS. On the one hand, technological progress of fully automated image acquisition platforms, and on the other hand advances in the field of automated image analysis have made this technology more powerful and more accessible to less specialized users. Image analysis solutions for many biological problems exist and more are being developed to increase both the quality and the quantity of data extracted from the images acquired during the screens. We highlight in this review some of the major challenges facing automatic high throughput image analysis and present some of the software solutions available on the market or from academic open source solutions.},

Compounds were described by different circular fingerprints, ECFP_4 and MOLPRINT 2D. A detailed analysis of the resulting approximately 2.4 million predictions led to very similar measures for overall accuracy for both classifiers, whereas we observed significant differences for individual activity classes. Moreover, we analyzed our data with respect to the numbers of compounds which are exclusively retrieved by either of the algorithmsbut never by the otheror by neither of them. This provided detailed information that can never be obtained by considering the overall performance statistics alone.},

  Abstract                 = {Conformal prediction is introduced as an alternative approach to domain applicability estimation. The advantages of using conformal prediction are as follows: First, the approach is based on a consistent and well-defined mathematical framework. Second, the understanding of the confidence level concept in conformal predictions is straightforward, e.g. a confidence level of 0.8 means that the conformal predictor will commit, at most, 20\% errors (i.e., true values outside the assigned prediction range). Third, the confidence level can be varied depending on the situation where the model is to be applied and the consequences of such changes are readily understandable, i.e. prediction ranges are increased or decreased, and the changes can immediately be inspected. We demonstrate the usefulness of conformal prediction by applying it to 10 publicly available data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats.We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion.Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry.

Herein, a mathematical model to predict bone marrow toxicity (BMT) is presented which enables the rational design of SMKIs away from this safety liability. A specific example highlights how this model identifies critical structural modifications to avoid BMT. The model was built using a novel algorithm, which selects 19 representative kinases from a panel of 277 based upon their ATP-binding pocket sequences and ability to predict BMT in vivo for 48 SMKIs. A support vector machine classifier was trained on the selected kinases and accurately predicts BMT with 74\% accuracy. The model provides an efficient method for understanding SMKI-induced in vivo BMT earlier in drug discovery.},

  Abstract                 = {Kinases are heavily pursued pharmaceutical targets because of their mechanistic role in many diseases. Small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) are a compound class that includes marketed drugs and compounds in various stages of drug development. While effective, many SMKIs have been associated with toxicity including chromosomal damage. Screening for kinase-mediated toxicity as early as possible is crucial, as is a better understanding of how off-target kinase inhibition may give rise to chromosomal damage. To that end, we employed a competitive binding assay and an analytical method to predict the toxicity of SMKIs. Specifically, we developed a model based on the binding affinity of SMKIs to a panel of kinases to predict whether a compound tests positive for chromosome damage. As training data, we used the binding affinity of 113 SMKIs against a representative subset of all kinases (290 kinases), yielding a 113x290 data matrix. Additionally, these 113 SMKIs were tested for genotoxicity in an in vitro micronucleus test (MNT). Among a variety of models from our analytical toolbox, we selected using cross-validation a combination of feature selection and pattern recognition techniques: Kolmogorov-Smirnov/T-test hybrid as a univariate filter, followed by Random Forests for feature selection and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for pattern recognition. Feature selection identified 21 kinases predictive of MNT. Using the corresponding binding affinities, the SVM could accurately predict MNT results with 85\% accuracy (68\% sensitivity, 91\% specificity). This indicates that kinase inhibition profiles are predictive of SMKI genotoxicity. While in vitro testing is required for regulatory review, our analysis identified a fast and cost-efficient method for screening out compounds earlier in drug development. Equally important, by identifying a panel of kinases predictive of genotoxicity, we provide medicinal chemists a set of kinases to avoid when designing compounds, thereby providing a basis for rational drug design away from genotoxicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Risk assessment for most human health effects is based on the threshold of a toxicological effect, usually derived from animal experiments. The Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) is a concept that refers to the establishment of a level of exposure for all chemicals below which there would be no appreciable risk to human health. When carefully applied, the TTC concept can provide a means of waiving testing based on knowledge of exposure limits. Two main approaches exist; the first of these is a General Threshold of Toxicological Concern; the second approach is a TTC in relation to structural information and/or toxicological data of chemicals. The structural scheme most routinely used is that of Cramer and co-workers from 1978. Recently this scheme was encoded into a software program called Toxtree, specifically commissioned by the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB). Here we evaluate two published datasets using Toxtree to demonstrate its concordance and highlight potential software modifications. The results were promising with an overall good concordance between the reported classifications and those generated by Toxtree. Further evaluation of these results highlighted a number of inconsistencies which were examined in turn and rationalised as far as possible. Improvements for Toxtree were proposed where appropriate. Notable of these is a necessity to update the lists of common food components and normal body constituents as these accounted for the majority of false classifications observed. Overall Toxtree was found to be a useful tool in facilitating the systematic evaluation of compounds through the Cramer scheme.},

A common approach has so far been to cover as much of the chemical space as possible by screening a chemically diverse set of compounds. We show that, rather than chemical diversity, the biologic diversity of a compound library is an essential requirement for hit identification. We describe a simple and efficient approach for the design of a HTS library based on compound-target diversity. Biodiverse compound subsets outperform chemically diverse libraries regarding hit rate and the total number of unique chemical scaffolds present among hits. Specifically, by screening ~19\% of a HTS collection, we expect to discover ~50-80\% of all desired bioactive compounds.},

  Abstract                 = {Increased availability of large repositories of chemical compounds is creating new challenges and opportunities for the application of machine learning methods to problems in computational chemistry and chemical informatics. Because chemical compounds are often represented by the graph of their covalent bonds, machine learning methods in this domain must be capable of processing graphical structures with variable size. Here, we first briefly review the literature on graph kernels and then introduce three new kernels (Tanimoto, MinMax, Hybrid) based on the idea of molecular fingerprints and counting labeled paths of depth up to d using depth-first search from each possible vertex. The kernels are applied to three classification problems to predict mutagenicity, toxicity, and anti-cancer activity on three publicly available data sets. The kernels achieve performances at least comparable, and most often superior, to those previously reported in the literature reaching accuracies of 91.5\% on the Mutag dataset, 65-67\% on the PTC (Predictive Toxicology Challenge) dataset, and 72\% on the NCI (National Cancer Institute) dataset. Properties and tradeoffs of these kernels, as well as other proposed kernels that leverage 1D or 3D representations of molecules, are briefly discussed.},

To train these architectures at scale, we gather large amounts of data from public sources to create a dataset of nearly 40 million measurements across more than 200 biological targets. We investigate several aspects of the multitask framework by performing a series of empirical studies and obtain some interesting results: (1) massively multitask networks obtain predictive accuracies significantly better than single-task methods, (2) the predictive power of multitask networks improves as additional tasks and data are added, (3) the total amount of data and the total number of tasks both contribute significantly to multitask improvement, and (4) multitask networks afford limited transferability to tasks not in the training set. Our results underscore the need for greater data sharing and further algorithmic innovation to accelerate the drug discovery process.},

  Abstract                 = {High-content screening (HCS) is a powerful technique for monitoring phenotypic responses to treatments on a cellular and subcellular level. Cellular phenotypes can be characterized by multivariate image readouts such as shape, intensity, or texture. The corresponding feature vectors can thus be defined as HCS fingerprints that serve as a powerful biological compound descriptor. Therefore, clustering or classification of HCS fingerprints across compound treatments allows for the identification of similarities in protein targets or pathways. We developed an HCS-based profiling panel that serves as basis for characterizing the mode of action of compounds. This panel measures phenotypic effects in six different compartments of U-2OS cells, namely the nucleus, the cytoplasm, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the cytoskeleton. We profiled a set of 2,725 well-annotated compounds and clustered their corresponding HCS fingerprints to establish links between predominant cellular phenotypes and cellular processes and protein targets. We found various different clusters enriched for individual targets (e.g., HDAC, HSP90, TOP1, HMGCR, TUB), signaling pathways (e.g., PIK3/AKT/mTOR), or gene sets associated with diseases (e.g., psoriasis, leukemia). Based on this clustering we were able to identify novel compound-target associations for selected compounds such as a submicromolar inhibitory activity of Silmitasertib (a casein kinase inhibitor) on PI3K and mTOR.},

  Abstract                 = {High-content screening (HCS) is a powerful tool for drug discovery being capable of measuring cellular responses to chemical disturbance in a high-throughput manner. HCS provides an image-based readout of cellular phenotypes, including features such as shape, intensity, or texture in a highly multiplexed and quantitative manner. The corresponding feature vectors can be used to characterize phenotypes and are thus defined as HCS fingerprints. Systematic analyses of HCS fingerprints allow for objective computational comparisons of cellular responses. Such comparisons therefore facilitate the detection of different compounds with different phenotypic outcomes from high-throughput HCS campaigns. Feature selection methods and similarity measures, as a basis for phenotype identification and clustering, are critical for the quality of such computational analyses. We systematically evaluated 16 different similarity measures in combination with linear and nonlinear feature selection methods for their potential to capture biologically relevant image features. Nonlinear correlation-based similarity measures such as Kendall's τ and Spearman's ρ perform well in most evaluation scenarios, outperforming other frequently used metrics (such as the Euclidian distance). We also present four novel modifications of the connectivity map similarity that surpass the original version, in our experiments. This study provides a basis for generic phenotypic analysis in future HCS campaigns.},

  Abstract                 = {Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) are a novel class of topological fingerprints for molecular characterization. Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECFPs were developed specifically for structure-activity modeling. ECFPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can be tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses. While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.},

It constitutes a technique from the field of spatial statistics and provides a mathematical framework for the nonparametric analysis of mapped point patterns. Here, refined nearest neighbor analysis is used to design benchmark data sets for virtual screening based on PubChem bioactivity data. A workflow is devised that purges data sets of compounds active against pharmaceutically relevant targets from unselective hits. Topological optimization using experimental design strategies monitored by refined nearest neighbor analysis functions is applied to generate corresponding data sets of actives and decoys that are unbiased with regard to analogue bias and artificial enrichment. These data sets provide a tool for Maximum Unbiased Validation (MUV) of virtual screening methods. The data sets and a software package implementing the MUV design workflow are freely available at http://www.pharmchem.tu-bs.de/lehre/baumann/MUV.html.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we describe the first prospective application of the shape-comparison program ROCS (Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures) to find new scaffolds for small molecule inhibitors of the ZipA-FtsZ protein-protein interaction, a proposed antibacterial target. The shape comparisons are made relative to the crystallographically determined, bioactive conformation of a high-throughput screening (HTS) hit. The use of ROCS led to the identification of a set of novel, weakly binding inhibitors with scaffolds presenting synthetic opportunities to further optimize biological affinity and lacking development issues associated with the HTS lead. These ROCS-identified scaffolds would have been missed using other structural similarity approaches such as ISIS 2D fingerprints. X-ray crystallographic analysis of one of the new inhibitors bound to ZipA reveals that the shape comparison approach very accurately predicted the binding mode. These experimental results validate this use of ROCS for chemotype switching or "lead hopping" and suggest that it is of general interest for lead identification in drug discovery endeavors.},

  Abstract                 = {Virtual screening is an effective way to find hits in drug discovery, with approaches ranging from fast information-based similarity methods to more computationally intensive physics-based docking methods. However, the best approach to use for a given project is not clear in advance of the screen. In this work, we show that combining results from multiple methods using a standard score (Z-score) can significantly improve virtual screening enrichments over any of the single screening methods. We show that an augmented Z-score, which considers the best two out of three scores for a given compound, outperforms previously published data fusion algorithms. We use three different virtual screening methods (two-dimensional (2D) fingerprint similarity, shape-based similarity, and docking) and study two different databases (DUD and MDDR). The average enrichment in the top 1\% was improved by 9\% for DUD and 25\% for the MDDR, compared with the top individual method. Improvements of 22\% for DUD and 43\% for MDDR are seen over the average of the three individual methods. Statistics are presented that show a high significance associated with the findings in this work.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug action can be rationalized as interaction of a molecule with proteins in a regulatory network of targets from a specific biological system. Both drug and side effects are often governed by interaction of the drug molecule with many, often unrelated, targets. Accordingly, arrays of protein-ligand interaction data from numerous in vitro profiling assays today provide growing evidence of polypharmacological drug interactions, even for marketed drugs. In vitro off-target profiling has therefore become an important tool in early drug discovery to learn about potential off-target liabilities, which are sometimes beneficial, but more often safety relevant. The rapidly developing field of in silico profiling approaches is complementing in vitro profiling. These approaches capitalize from large amounts of biochemical data from multiple sources to be exploited for optimizing undesirable side effects in pharmaceutical research. Therefore, current in silico profiling models are nowadays perceived as valuable tools in drug discovery, and promise a platform to support optimally informed decisions.},

In 2005, the NIH launched the decade-long Molecular Libraries Program with the intent of innovating in and broadening access to small-molecule science. This Perspective describes how novel small-molecule probes identified through the program are enabling the exploration of biological pathways and therapeutic hypotheses not otherwise testable. These experiences illustrate how small-molecule probes can help bridge the chasm between biological research and the development of medicines but also highlight the need to innovate the science of therapeutic discovery.},

Each protein is represented by a maximum of five crystal structures. We search a diverse subset of the MDDR as well as a diverse small subset of the MCIDB, Merck's proprietary database. It is seen that the relative effectiveness of virtual screening methods, as measured by the enrichment factor, is highly dependent on the particular crystal structure or ligand, and on the database being searched. 2D similarity methods appear very good for the MDDR, but poor for the MCIDB. However, ROCS-color (a 3D similarity method) does well for both databases.},

  Abstract                 = {During drug development, compounds are tested against counterscreens, a panel of off-target activities that would be undesirable for a drug to have. Testing every compound against every counterscreen is generally too costly in terms of time and money, and we need to find a rational way of prioritizing counterscreen testing. Here we present the eCounterscreening paradigm, wherein predictions from QSAR models for counterscreen activity are used to generate a recommendation as to whether a specific compound in a specific project should be tested against a specific counterscreen. The rules behind the recommendations, which can be summarized in a risk-benefit plot specific for a counterscreen/project combination, are based on a previously assembled database of prospective QSAR predictions. The recommendations require two user-defined cutoffs: the level of activity in a specific counterscreen that is considered undesirable and the level of risk the chemist is willing to accept that an undesired counterscreen activity will go undetected. We demonstrate in a simulated prospective experiment that eCounterscreening can be used to postpone a large fraction of counterscreen testing and still have an acceptably low risk of undetected counterscreen activity.},

Here, we present a systematic computational approach to predict novel therapeutic indications on the basis of comprehensive testing of molecular signatures in drug-disease pairs. We integrated gene expression measurements from 100 diseases and gene expression measurements on 164 drug compounds, yielding predicted therapeutic potentials for these drugs. We recovered many known drug and disease relationships using computationally derived therapeutic potentials and also predict many new indications for these 164 drugs. We experimentally validated a prediction for the antiulcer drug cimetidine as a candidate therapeutic in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma, and demonstrate its efficacy both in vitro and in vivo using mouse xenograft models. This computational method provides a systematic approach for repositioning established drugs to treat a wide range of human diseases.},

This analysis was carried out using calculable chemical structure identifiers developed by the NCI CADD Group, based on hash codes available in the chemoinformatics toolkit CACTVS and a newly developed scoring scheme to define a canonical tautomer for any encountered structure. CACTVS's tautomerism definition, a set of 21 transform rules expressed in SMIRKS line notation, was used, which takes a comprehensive stance as to the possible types of tautomeric interconversion included. Tautomerism was found to be possible for more than 2/3 of the unique structures in the CSDB. A total of 680 million tautomers were calculated from, and including, the original structure records. Tautomerism overlap within the same individual database (i.e. at least one other entry was present that was really only a different tautomeric representation of the same compound) was found at an average rate of 0.3\% of the original structure records, with values as high as nearly 2\% for some of the databases in CSDB. Projected onto the set of unique structures (by FICuS identifier), this still occurred in about 1.5\% of the cases. Tautomeric overlap across all constituent databases in CSDB was found for nearly 10\% of the records in the collection.},

There are a number of applications but in toxicology the most pertinent is for understanding mechanisms of toxicity. In its essence the process involves comparing a query gene signature generated as a result of exposure of a biological system to a chemical to those in a database that have been previously derived. In the ideal situation the query gene-expression signature is characteristic of the event and will be matched to similar events in the database. Key criteria are therefore the means of choosing the signature to be matched and the means by which the match is made. In this article we explore these concepts with examples applicable to toxicology.},

In this paper, we questioned the Protein Data Bank to better understand the reasons for the promiscuity of bioactive compounds. We assembled a data set of >1000 pairs of three-dimensional structures of complexes between a "drug-like" ligand (as its physicochemical properties overlap that of approved drugs) and two distinct "druggable" protein targets (as their binding sites are likely to accommodate "drug-like" ligands). Studying the similarity between the ligand-binding sites in the different targets revealed that the lack of selectivity of a ligand can be due (i) to the fact that Nature has created the same binding pocket in different proteins, which do not necessarily have otherwise sequence or fold similarity, or (ii) to specific characteristics of the ligand itself. In particular, we demonstrated that many ligands can adapt to different protein environments by changing their conformation, by using different chemical moieties to anchor to different targets, or by adopting unusual extreme binding modes (e.g., only apolar contact between the ligand and the protein, even though polar groups are present on the ligand or at the protein surface). Lastly, we provided new elements in support to the recent studies which suggest that the promiscuity of a ligand might be inferred from its molecular complexity.},

Cross-docking, or using a protein structure from a complex containing a different ligand, provides a more realistic assessment of a docking program's ability to reproduce X-ray results. In this work, cross-docking was performed with CDocker, Fred, and Rocs using multiple X-ray structures for eight proteins (two kinases, one nuclear hormone receptor, one serine protease, two metalloproteases, and two phosphodiesterases). While average cross-docking accuracy is not encouraging, it is shown that using the protein structure from the complex that contains the bound ligand most similar to the docked ligand increases docking accuracy for all methods ("similarity selection"). Identifying the most successful protein conformer ("best selection") and similarity selection substantially reduce the difference between self-docking and average cross-docking accuracy. We identify universal predictors of docking accuracy (i.e., showing consistent behavior across most protein-method combinations), and show that models for predicting docking accuracy built using these parameters can be used to select the most appropriate docking method.},

In many situations, knowing if private datasets overlap determines if it is worthwhile to navigate the institutional, ethical, and legal barriers that govern access to sensitive, private data. We report the first method of publicly measuring the overlap between private datasets that is secure under a malicious model without relying on private protocols or message passing. This method uses a publicly shareable summary of a dataset's contents, its cryptoset, to estimate its overlap with other datasets. Cryptosets approach "information-theoretic" security, the strongest type of security possible in cryptography, which is not even crackable with infinite computing power. We empirically and theoretically assess both the accuracy of these estimates and the security of the approach, demonstrating that cryptosets are informative, with a stable accuracy, and secure.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, in order to elucidate the action mechanism of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) that exhibit clinical efficacy for type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), an integrated protocol that combines molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping was employed to find the potential inhibitors from TCM for the T2DM-related targets and establish the compound-target interaction network. First, the prediction capabilities of molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping to distinguish inhibitors from noninhibitors for the selected T2DM-related targets were evaluated. The results show that molecular docking or pharmacophore mapping can give satisfactory predictions for most targets but the validations are still quite necessary because the prediction accuracies of these two methods are variable across different targets. Then, the Bayesian classifiers by integrating the predictions from molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping were developed, and the well-validated Bayesian classifiers for 15 targets were utilized to find the potential inhibitors from TCM and establish the compound-target interaction network. The analysis of the compound-target network demonstrates that a small portion (18.6\%) of the predicted inhibitors can interact with multitargets. The pharmacological activities for some potential inhibitors have been experimentally confirmed, highlighting the reliability of the Bayesian classifiers. Besides, it is interesting to find that a considerable number of the predicted multitarget inhibitors have free radical scavenging/antioxidant activities, which are closely related to T2DM. It appears that the pharmacological effect of the TCM formulas is determined not only by the compounds that interact directly with one or more T2DM-related targets, but also by the compounds with other supplementary bioactivities important for relieving T2DM, such as free radical scavenging/antioxidant effects. The mechanism uncovered by this study may offer a deep insight for understanding the theory of the classical TCM formulas for combating T2DM. Moreover, the predicted inhibitors for the T2DM-related targets may provide a good source to find new lead compounds against T2DM.},

In the present article, we describe the latest developments of Endeavour. First, we provide a web-based user interface, besides our Java client, to make Endeavour more universally accessible. Second, we support multiple species: in addition to Homo sapiens, we now provide gene prioritization for three major model organisms: Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Caenorhabditis elegans. Third, Endeavour makes use of additional data sources and is now including numerous databases: ontologies and annotations, protein-protein interactions, cis-regulatory information, gene expression data sets, sequence information and text-mining data. We tested the novel version of Endeavour on 32 recent disease gene associations from the literature. Additionally, we describe a number of recent independent studies that made use of Endeavour to prioritize candidate genes for obesity and Type II diabetes, cleft lip and cleft palate, and pulmonary fibrosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Early evaluation of new drug entities for their potential to cause mitochondrial dysfunction is becoming an important task for drug development. Multi-parametric high-content screening (mp-HCS) of mitochondrial toxicity holds promise as a lead in-vitro strategy for drug testing and safety evaluations. In this study, we have developed a mp-HCS and multi-parametric data analysis scheme for assessing cell responses to induced mitochondrial perturbation. The mp-HCS measurements are shown to be robust enough to allow for quantitative comparison of biological systems with different metabolic pathways simulated by alteration of growth media. Substitution of medium glucose for galactose sensitized cells to drug action and revealed novel response parameters. Each compound was quantitatively characterized according to induced phenotypic changes of cell morphology and functionality measured by fluorescent biomarkers for mitochondrial activity, plasma membrane permeability, and nuclear morphology. Descriptors of drug effects were established by generation of a SCRIT (Specialized-Cell-Response-to-Induced-Toxicity) vector, consisting of normalized statistical measures of each parameter at each dose and growth condition. The dimensionality of SCRIT vectors depends on the number of parameters chosen, which in turn depends on the hypothesis being tested. Specifically, incorporation of three parameters of response into SCRIT vectors enabled clustering of 84 training compounds with known pharmacological and toxicological activities according to the degree of toxicity and mitochondrial involvement. Inclusion of 6 parameters enabled the resolution of more subtle differences between compounds within a common therapeutic class; scoring enabled a ranking of statins in direct agreement with clinical outcomes. Comparison of drug-induced changes required variations in glucose for separation of mitochondrial dysfunction from other types of cytotoxicity. These results also demonstrate that the number of drugs in a training set, the choice of parameters used in analysis, and statistical measures are fundamental for specific hypothesis testing and assessment of quantitative phenotypic differences.},

  Abstract                 = {The in silico prediction of potential interactions between drugs and target proteins is of core importance for the identification of new drugs or novel targets for existing drugs. However, only a tiny portion of all drug-target pairs in current datasets are experimentally validated interactions. This motivates the need for developing computational methods that predict true interaction pairs with high accuracy.We show that a simple machine learning method that uses the drug-target network as the only source of information is capable of predicting true interaction pairs with high accuracy. Specifically, we introduce interaction profiles of drugs (and of targets) in a network, which are binary vectors specifying the presence or absence of interaction with every target (drug) in that network. We define a kernel on these profiles, called the Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel, and use a simple classifier, (kernel) Regularized Least Squares (RLS), for prediction drug-target interactions. We test comparatively the effectiveness of RLS with the GIP kernel on four drug-target interaction networks used in previous studies. The proposed algorithm achieves area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) up to 92.7, significantly improving over results of state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we show that using also kernels based on chemical and genomic information further increases accuracy, with a neat improvement on small datasets. These results substantiate the relevance of the network topology (in the form of interaction profiles) as source of information for predicting drug-target interactions.Software and Supplementary Material are available at http://cs.ru.nl/~tvanlaarhoven/drugtarget2011/.tvanlaarhoven@cs.ru.nl; elenam@cs.ru.nl.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract                 = {While a large body of work exists on comparing and benchmarking descriptors of molecular structures, a similar comparison of protein descriptor sets is lacking. Hence, in the current work a total of 13 amino acid descriptor sets have been benchmarked with respect to their ability of establishing bioactivity models. The descriptor sets included in the study are Z-scales (3 variants), VHSE, T-scales, ST-scales, MS-WHIM, FASGAI, BLOSUM, a novel protein descriptor set (termed ProtFP (4 variants)), and in addition we created and benchmarked three pairs of descriptor combinations. Prediction performance was evaluated in seven structure-activity benchmarks which comprise Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) dipeptidic inhibitor data, and three proteochemometric data sets, namely (1) GPCR ligands modeled against a GPCR panel, (2) enzyme inhibitors (NNRTIs) with associated bioactivities against a set of HIV enzyme mutants, and (3) enzyme inhibitors (PIs) with associated bioactivities on a large set of HIV enzyme mutants.The amino acid descriptor sets compared here show similar performance (<0.1 log units RMSE difference and <0.1 difference in MCC), while errors for individual proteins were in some cases found to be larger than those resulting from descriptor set differences ( > 0.3 log units RMSE difference and >0.7 difference in MCC). Combining different descriptor sets generally leads to better modeling performance than utilizing individual sets. The best performers were Z-scales (3) combined with ProtFP (Feature), or Z-Scales (3) combined with an average Z-Scale value for each target, while ProtFP (PCA8), ST-Scales, and ProtFP (Feature) rank last.While amino acid descriptor sets capture different aspects of amino acids their ability to be used for bioactivity modeling is still -- on average -- surprisingly similar. Still, combining sets describing complementary information consistently leads to small but consistent improvement in modeling performance (average MCC 0.01 better, average RMSE 0.01 log units lower). Finally, performance differences exist between the targets compared thereby underlining that choosing an appropriate descriptor set is of fundamental for bioactivity modeling, both from the ligand- as well as the protein side.},

  Abstract                 = {While a large body of work exists on comparing and benchmarking of descriptors of molecular structures, a similar comparison of protein descriptor sets is lacking. Hence, in the current work a total of 13 different protein descriptor sets have been compared with respect to their behavior in perceiving similarities between amino acids. The descriptor sets included in the study are Z-scales (3 variants), VHSE, T-scales, ST-scales, MS-WHIM, FASGAI and BLOSUM, and a novel protein descriptor set termed ProtFP (4 variants). We investigate to which extent descriptor sets show collinear as well as orthogonal behavior via principal component analysis (PCA).In describing amino acid similarities, MSWHIM, T-scales and ST-scales show related behavior, as do the VHSE, FASGAI, and ProtFP (PCA3) descriptor sets. Conversely, the ProtFP (PCA5), ProtFP (PCA8), Z-Scales (Binned), and BLOSUM descriptor sets show behavior that is distinct from one another as well as both of the clusters above. Generally, the use of more principal components (>3 per amino acid, per descriptor) leads to a significant differences in the way amino acids are described, despite that the later principal components capture less variation per component of the original input data.In this work a comparison is provided of how similar (and differently) currently available amino acids descriptor sets behave when converting structure to property space. The results obtained enable molecular modelers to select suitable amino acid descriptor sets for structure-activity analyses, e.g. those showing complementary behavior.},

Decoy databases for the two targets under examination, adenosine deaminase and retinoid X receptor alpha, were obtained from the Directory of Useful Decoys and were further enriched with approximately 5\% of active ligands. Structure and ligand-based methods were used to generate the ligand poses, and a Tanimoto metric was chosen for the calculation of the similarity interaction fingerprint between the reference ligand and the screening database. Database enrichments were found to strongly depend on the pose generator algorithm. In spite of these dependencies, enrichments using molecular IFPs were comparable to those obtained with GlideXP, Gold, ROCS, and the Bayesian classifier. More interestingly, the molecular IFP scoring algorithm outperformed these methods at scaffold hopping enrichment, regardless of the pose generator algorithm.},

For eight drug discovery projects within a global pharmaceutical company, gene expression data were informative and able to support go/no-go decisions.

The individual chemicals for which these data were available were classified according to the rulebase under consideration and predictions of effect concentrations or ranges of possible effect concentrations were generated. These predictions were compared to the actual toxicity data retrieved from the database. The results of this comparison show that generally, the classification system provides adequate predictions of either the aquatic toxicity (class 1) or the possible range of toxicity (other classes) of organic compounds. A slight underestimation of effect concentrations occurs for some highly water soluble, reactive chemicals with low log K(ow) values. On the other end of the scale, some compounds that are classified as belonging to a relatively toxic class appear to belong to the so-called baseline toxicity compounds. For some of these, additional classification rules are proposed. Furthermore, some groups of compounds cannot be classified, although they should be amenable to predictions. For these compounds additional research as to class membership and associated prediction rules is proposed.},

Here, we describe the compilation and analysis of combined data on the attrition of drug candidates from AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. The analysis reaffirms that control of physicochemical properties during compound optimization is beneficial in identifying compounds of candidate drug quality and indicates for the first time a link between the physicochemical properties of compounds and clinical failure due to safety issues. The results also suggest that further control of physicochemical properties is unlikely to have a significant effect on attrition rates and that additional work is required to address safety-related failures. Further cross-company collaborations will be crucial to future progress in this area.},

In benchmark calculations, our approach accessed subsets of compounds that were substantially enriched in chemically diverse hit compounds for various activity classes. Overall, half of the hits in the screening collection were found by screening only 10\% of the library.

  Abstract                 = {Virtual screening using bioactivity profiles has become an integral part of currently applied hit finding methods in pharmaceutical industry. However, a significant drawback of this approach is that it is only applicable to compounds that have been biologically tested in the past and have sufficient activity annotations for meaningful profile comparisons. Although bioactivity data generated in pharmaceutical institutions are growing on an unprecedented scale, the number of biologically annotated compounds still covers only a minuscule fraction of chemical space. For a newly synthesized compound or an isolated natural product to be biologically characterized across multiple assays, it may take a considerable amount of time. Consequently, this chemical matter will not be included in virtual screening campaigns based on bioactivity profiles. To overcome this problem, we herein introduce bioturbo similarity searching that uses chemical similarity to map molecules without biological annotations into bioactivity space and then searches for biologically similar compounds in this reference system. In benchmark calculations on primary screening data, we demonstrate that our approach generally achieves higher hit rates and identifies structurally more diverse compounds than approaches using chemical information only. Furthermore, our method is able to discover hits with novel modes of inhibition that traditional 2D and 3D similarity approaches are unlikely to discover. Test calculations on a set of natural products reveal the practical utility of the approach for identifying novel and synthetically more accessible chemical matter.},

Here, we confirm earlier results showing that this inference is not always valid and suggest instead using biological measurement diversity derived from multiplexed profiling in the construction of libraries with diverse assay performance patterns for cell-based screens. Rather than using results from tens or hundreds of completed assays, which is resource intensive and not easily extensible, we use high-dimensional image-based cell morphology and gene expression profiles. We piloted this approach using over 30,000 compounds. We show that small-molecule profiling can be used to select compound sets with high rates of activity and diverse biological performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Since 1990, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has screened more than 60,000 compounds against a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines. The 50-percent growth-inhibitory concentration (GI50) for any single cell line is simply an index of cytotoxicity or cytostasis, but the patterns of 60 such GI50 values encode unexpectedly rich, detailed information on mechanisms of drug action and drug resistance. Each compound's pattern is like a fingerprint, essentially unique among the many billions of distinguishable possibilities. These activity patterns are being used in conjunction with molecular structural features of the tested agents to explore the NCI's database of more than 460,000 compounds, and they are providing insight into potential target molecules and modulators of activity in the 60 cell lines. For example, the information is being used to search for candidate anticancer drugs that are not dependent on intact p53 suppressor gene function for their activity. It remains to be seen how effective this information-intensive strategy will be at generating new clinically active agents.},

Cell permeable small molecule tools have a major role in facilitating the functional annotation of the human genome, understanding both physiological and pathological processes, and validating new molecular targets. To be valuable, chemical tools must satisfy necessary criteria and recent publications have suggested objective guidelines for what makes a useful chemical probe. Although recognizing that such guidelines may be valuable, we caution against overly restrictive rules that may stifle innovation in favor of a "fit-for-purpose" approach. Reviewing the literature and providing examples from the cancer field, we recommend a series of "fitness factors" to be considered when assessing chemical probes. We hope this will encourage innovative chemical biology research while minimizing the generation of poor quality and misleading biological data, thus increasing understanding of the particular biological area, to the benefit of basic research and drug discovery.},

Using drugs as test agents and measuring a panel of cellular phenotypes that are directly linked to key mechanisms of hepatotoxicity, we have developed an in vitro testing strategy that is predictive of many clinical outcomes of DILI. Mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, and intracellular glutathione, all measured by high content cellular imaging in primary human hepatocyte cultures, are the three most important features contributing to the hepatotoxicity prediction. When applied to over 300 drugs and chemicals including many that caused rare and idiosyncratic liver toxicity in humans, our testing strategy has a true-positive rate of 50-60\% and an exceptionally low false-positive rate of 0-5\%. These in vitro predictions can augment the performance of the combined traditional preclinical animal tests by identifying idiosyncratic human hepatotoxicants such as nimesulide, telithromycin, nefazodone, troglitazone, tetracycline, sulindac, zileuton, labetalol, diclofenac, chlorzoxazone, dantrolene, and many others. Our findings provide insight to key DILI mechanisms, and suggest a new approach in hepatotoxicity testing of pharmaceuticals.},

  Abstract                 = {The high incidence of complex diseases has become a worldwide threat to human health. Multiple targets and pathways are perturbed during the pathological process of complex diseases. Systematic investigation of complex relationship between drugs and diseases is necessary for new association discovery and drug repurposing. For this purpose, three causal networks were constructed herein for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and neoplasms, respectively. A causal inference-probabilistic matrix factorization (CI-PMF) approach was proposed to predict and classify drug-disease associations, and further used for drug-repositioning predictions. First, multilevel systematic relations between drugs and diseases were integrated from heterogeneous databases to construct causal networks connecting drug-target-pathway-gene-disease. Then, the association scores between drugs and diseases were assessed by evaluating a drug's effects on multiple targets and pathways. Furthermore, PMF models were learned based on known interactions, and associations were then classified into three types by trained models. Finally, therapeutic associations were predicted based upon the ranking of association scores and predicted association types. In terms of drug-disease association prediction, modified causal inference included in CI-PMF outperformed existing causal inference with a higher AUC (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) score and greater precision. Moreover, CI-PMF performed better than single modified causal inference in predicting therapeutic drug-disease associations. In the top 30\% of predicted associations, 58.6\% (136/232), 50.8\% (31/61), and 39.8\% (140/352) hit known therapeutic associations, while precisions obtained by the latter were only 10.2\% (231/2264), 8.8\% (36/411), and 9.7\% (189/1948). Clinical verifications were further conducted for the top 100 newly predicted therapeutic associations. As a result, 21, 12, and 32 associations have been studied and many treatment effects of drugs on diseases were investigated for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and neoplasms, respectively. Related chains in causal networks were extracted for these 65 clinical-verified associations, and we further illustrated the therapeutic role of etodolac in breast cancer by inferred chains. Overall, CI-PMF is a useful approach for associating drugs with complex diseases and provides potential values for drug repositioning.},

  Abstract                 = {Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been widely used in data-mining and Big Data applications as modern commercial databases start to attach an increasing importance to the analytic capabilities. In recent years, SVM was adapted to the field of High Performance Computing for power/performance prediction, auto-tuning, and runtime scheduling. However, even at the risk of losing prediction accuracy due to insufficient runtime information, researchers can only afford to apply offline model training to avoid significant runtime training overhead. Advanced multi- and many-core architectures offer massive parallelism with complex memory hierarchies which can make runtime training possible, but form a barrier to efficient parallel SVM design. To address the challenges above, we designed and implemented MIC-SVM, a highly efficient parallel SVM for x86 based multi-core and many-core architectures, such as the Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs and Intel Xeon Phi co-processor (MIC). We propose various novel analysis methods and optimization techniques to fully utilize the multilevel parallelism provided by these architectures and serve as general optimization methods for other machine learning tools. MIC-SVM achieves 4.4-84x and 18-47x speedups against the popular LIBSVM, on MIC and Ivy Bridge CPUs respectively, for several real-world data-mining datasets. Even compared with GPUSVM, run on a top of the line NVIDIA k20x GPU, the performance of our MIC-SVM is competitive. We also conduct a cross-platform performance comparison analysis, focusing on Ivy Bridge CPUs, MIC and GPUs, and provide insights on how to select the most suitable advanced architectures for specific algorithms and input data patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {High-content screening (HCS) uses computational analysis on large collections of unlabeled biological
image data to make discoveries in cell biology. While biological images have historically been analyzed
by inspection, advances in the automation of sample preparation and delivery, coupled with advances
in microscopy and data storage, have resulted in a massive increase in both the number and resolution
of images produced per study. These advances have facilitated genome-scale imaging studies, which
are increasingly frequent. Although the sheer volume of data involved strongly favours computational
analysis, many assays continue to be scored by eye. As a scoring method, visual inspection limits the
rate at which data may be analyzed, at increased cost and decreased reproducibility. In this thesis, we
propose computational methods for data analysis of HCS data.
We begin with feature data derived from confocal microscopy fluorescence images of yeast cell populations.
We use machine learning methods trained on a small labeled subset of that feature data to
robustly score each population with respect to a DNA damage focus phenotype. We then introduce
a method for using deep autoencoders trained using a label-free objective to perform dimensionality
reduction. This allows us to model the non-linear relations between features in high-dimensional data.
The computational complexity of our approach scales linearly with the number of examples, allowing
us to train on a much larger number of samples. Finally, we propose an outlier detection method for
discovering populations that present significantly different distributions of cellular phenotypes as compared
to wild-type using nonparametric Bayesian clustering on the low-dimensional data. We evaluate

  Abstract                 = {Interaction of a drug or chemical with a biological system can result in a gene-expression profile or signature characteristic of the event. Using a suitably robust algorithm these signatures can potentially be used to connect molecules with similar pharmacological or toxicological properties by gene expression profile. Lamb et al first proposed the Connectivity Map [Lamb et al (2006), Science 313, 1929-1935] to make successful connections among small molecules, genes, and diseases using genomic signatures.Here we have built on the principles of the Connectivity Map to present a simpler and more robust method for the construction of reference gene-expression profiles and for the connection scoring scheme, which importantly allows the valuation of statistical significance of all the connections observed. We tested the new method with two randomly generated gene signatures and three experimentally derived gene signatures (for HDAC inhibitors, estrogens, and immunosuppressive drugs, respectively). Our testing with this method indicates that it achieves a higher level of specificity and sensitivity and so advances the original method.The method presented here not only offers more principled statistical procedures for testing connections, but more importantly it provides effective safeguard against false connections at the same time achieving increased sensitivity. With its robust performance, the method has potential use in the drug development pipeline for the early recognition of pharmacological and toxicological properties in chemicals and new drug candidates, and also more broadly in other 'omics sciences.},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying unexpected drug-protein interactions is crucial for drug repurposing. We develop a comprehensive proteome scale approach that predicts human protein targets and side effects of drugs. For drug-protein interaction prediction, FINDSITE(comb), whose average precision is ~30\% and recall ~27\%, is employed. For side effect prediction, a new method is developed with a precision of ~57\% and a recall of ~24\%. Our predictions show that drugs are quite promiscuous, with the average (median) number of human targets per drug of 329 (38), while a given protein interacts with 57 drugs. The result implies that drug side effects are inevitable and existing drugs may be useful for repurposing, with only ~1,000 human proteins likely causing serious side effects. A killing index derived from serious side effects has a strong correlation with FDA approved drugs being withdrawn. Therefore, it provides a pre-filter for new drug development. The methodology is free to the academic community on the DR. PRODIS (DRugome, PROteome, and DISeasome) webserver at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/dr.prodis/. DR. PRODIS provides protein targets of drugs, drugs for a given protein target, associated diseases and side effects of drugs, as well as an interface for the virtual target screening of new compounds.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of effective methods for the characterization of gene functions that are able to combine diverse data sources in a sound and easily-extendible way is an important goal in computational biology. We have previously developed a general matrix factorization-based data fusion approach for gene function prediction. In this manuscript, we show that this data fusion approach can be applied to gene function prediction and that it can fuse various heterogeneous data sources, such as gene expression profiles, known protein annotations, interaction and literature data. The fusion is achieved by simultaneous matrix tri-factorization that shares matrix factors between sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by evaluating its performance on predicting ontological annotations in slime mold D. discoideum and on recognizing proteins of baker's yeast S. cerevisiae that participate in the ribosome or are located in the cell membrane. Our approach achieves predictive performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art kernel-based data fusion, but requires fewer data preprocessing steps.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional studies of liver toxicity involve screening compounds through in vivo and in vitro tests. They need to distinguish between compounds that represent little or no health concern and those with the greatest likelihood to cause adverse effects in humans. High-throughput and toxicogenomic screening methods coupled with a plethora of circumstantial evidence provide a challenge for improved toxicity prediction and require appropriate computational methods that integrate various biological, chemical and toxicological data. We report on a data fusion approach for prediction of drug-induced liver injury potential in humans using microarray data from the Japanese Toxicogenomics Project (TGP) as provided for the contest by CAMDA 2013 Conference. Our aim was to investigate if the data from different TGP studies could be fused together to boost prediction accuracy. We were also interested if in vitro studies provided sufficient information to refrain from studies in animals. We show that our recently proposed matrix factorization-based data fusion provides an elegant computational framework for integration of the TGP and related data sets, 29 data sets in total. Fusion yields a high cross-validated accuracy (AUC of 0.819 for in vivo assays), which is above the accuracy of the established machine learning procedure of stacked classification with feature selection. Our data analysis shows that animal studies may be replaced with in vitro assays (AUC = 0.799) and that liver injury in humans can be predicted from animal data (AUC = 0.811). Our principal contribution is a demonstration that analysis of toxicogenomic data can substantially benefit from data fusion with directly and circumstantially related data sets.},

  abstract    = {Predicting the cellular response of compounds is a challenge central for the discovery of new drugs. Compound biological signatures have risen as a way of representing the perturbation produced by a compound in the cell. However, their ability to encode specific phenotypic information and generating tangible predictions remains unknown, mainly because of the inherent noise in such data sets. In this work, we statistically aggregate signal from several biological signatures to find compounds that produce a desired phenotype in the cell. We exploit this method in two applications relevant for phenotypic screening in drug discovery programs: target-independent hit expansion and target identification. As a result, we present here (i) novel nanomolar inhibitors of cellular division that reproduce the phenotype and the mode of action of reference natural products and (ii) blockers of the NKCC1 co-transporter for autism spectrum disorders. Our results were confirmed in both cellular and biochemical assays of the respective projects. In addition, these examples provided novel insights on the information content and biological significance of compound biological signatures from HTS, and their applicability to drug discovery in general. For target identification, we show that novel targets can be predicted successfully for drugs by reporting new activities for nimedipine, fluspirilene and pimozide and providing a rationale for repurposing and side effects. Our results highlight the opportunities of reusing public bioactivity data for prospective drug discovery, including scenarios where the effective target or mode of action of a particular molecule is not known, such as in phenotypic screening campaigns.},
